### Jar's Core Insights

population is like this – they grew in a small town, very aspirational, watched their heroes flaunt everything in movies, they saw their rich cousins from tier one cities flaunt everything, wanted all those things, but they could never never afford one.

No one taught us how to behave with money. No one taught us how to build the right habits15, right relationships with money. No one taught us discipline around money. 



### Here's my beef with JarApp


### Why I started using Jar


### Why it works

There is no platform for a common man to do things in a small, simple manner and that was the triggering point for us; that we can build a platform which will basically help people start. And build the right habits around money, build the right relationship with money, and slowly from there we will help them diversify into multiple investments.

> Gold is something which everyone understands. 

The relationship with money is the same thing. You need to first teach him habit, discipline, behaviour and then you would teach him diversified asset class, hedging the risk, long term plan, short term plan, short term goals, long term goals, retirement goals, this that. 

 a habit-forming platform and you don’t crash into a habit
 -> Pay using UPI - Round-off -> notify of change in every transaction -> incentivise to invest -> Invest -> reward with a free spin -> Invest in Gold

 Other Eg: Apple Fitness Rings, Cred to an extend with reminders to pay for 

Simplified DM for investing with least req. for thought

Building virality pre-baked with the features
