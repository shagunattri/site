Open-Source and the free software community has flourished in the recent years with developments and collaborative projects from multi million dollar coprorations to individual ninja devs across the globe many systems across the globe rely on opensource software and their maintainers.

From servers running the linux kernel to sending encrypted emails with confidential data,opensource libraries and projects have made the software world flourish with 
projects like flutter,to the code editor I'm using to write this blog Vscode, to the framework that is used to serve this website Hugo,to the shell that I run on my computer Fish shell are made possible by countless opensource software contributors on platforms like Github,Gitlab and Bitbucket that made this dream come true.

Open source tools and softwares are what we rely on to serve our applications.I can't imagine a future without github,a VCS or any form open source collaboration tool.But yeah,now that you understand the potential of open source and it's uses I find it amazing that the push to a open-source software development is the way to go.

The fact that it offers collaboration,learing and a community around a tool/product is a great by-product that is simply not possible with any closed source tool/project.Your contribution and sense of responbility to maintain a piece of software becomes your job as a maintainer.

Through the oss movement, it made the path to opensourcing software easier and allowed for a sense of transperancy among software products, 
but still a lot of software and products comes under the radar when it comes to *\*cough*\* #OpensourceAarogyaSetu *\*cough*\*  &
 the ways corporations make software  *\*cough*\* Xiaomi Mint Browser *\*cough*\*.


Open sourcing is always good as it has a lot to offer.
- Allows transparency and trust.
- Helps secure your products with better eyes to look at your code and improve.
- An online community to care for.
- Better & faster development.
- Constant feedback and updates.


The fact that you allow the world to look at your code and help improve is not something you would wanna ditch when it comes to learning and collaborating.

Kudos to github for being a firm believer in open source,helping the devs and becoming a platform for what it is now and ever growing.

I've had yet to make a major contribution to a open source lib but with my current experience and mini-contributions it for sure as hell gonna be a learning adventure I am thrilled to look up for.


As a part of my contribution to the community I've made two open source tools....
- [sub3num](https://github.com/shagunattri/sub3num) A sudomain enumeration tools for pentesters.
- [pwGen](https://github.com/shagunattri/pwGen) A mnml password generator.

Both these tools were my attempt to making tools for the open source community.

I plan on writing more tools and sharing them with y'all till then keep em pull requests coming..
