## Introduction: A Welcome Change in Digital Governance

India’s **UX4G** (User Experience for Government) initiative—under the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) as part of Digital India—is transforming how citizens interact with digital government services. By prioritizing accessibility, usability, and a user-first approach, UX4G is setting a new standard in public digital services.

*Why this matters:* For too long, government services online were functional but not always accessible or intuitive. UX4G breaks that mold, ushering in an era where government digital services are inclusive, efficient, and citizen-centered.
