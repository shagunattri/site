                <p>Open-Source and the free software community has flourished in the recent years with developments and collaborative projects from multi-million dollar corporations to individual ninja devs across the globe many systems across the globe rely on opensource software and their maintainers.</p>
<p>From servers running the linux kernel to sending encrypted emails with confidential data,opensource libraries and projects have made the software world flourish with
projects like <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/">flutter</a>,to the code editor I&rsquo;m using to write this blog <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Vscode</a>,the framework that is used to serve this website <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>,to the shell that I run on my computer <a href="https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish">oh-my-fish</a> are made possible by countless opensource software contributors on platforms like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>,<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> that have made this dream come true.</p>
<p>Open source tools and softwares are what we rely on to serve our applications.One cannot imagine a future without github,a VCS or any form of open source collaboration tool.But yeah,now that the potential of open source is huge alogn with it&rsquo;s uses I find it amazing that the push to a open-source software development is the way to go and always a option to consider.</p>
<p>The fact that it offers collaboration,learing and a community around a tool/product is a great by-product that is simply not possible with any closed source tool/project.Your contribution and sense of responbility to maintain a piece of software becomes your job as a maintainer.</p>
<p>Through the <strong>OSS</strong> movement,the path to opensourcing software is easier than ever and allows for a sense of transperancy among software products,
but still a lot of software and products comes under the radar when it comes to <em>*cough</em>* #OpensourceAarogyaSetu <em>*cough</em>*  &amp; the ways corporations make software <em>*cough</em>* Xiaomi Mint Browser <em>*cough</em>*.</p>
<p>Open sourcing is always good as it has a lot to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows transparency and trust.</li>
<li>Helps secure your products with better eyes to look at your code and improve.</li>
<li>An online community to care for.</li>
<li>Better &amp; faster development.</li>
<li>Constant feedback and updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you allow the world to look at your code and help improve is not something you would wanna ditch when it comes to learning and collaborating.</p>
<p>Kudos to github for being a firm believer in <strong>OSS</strong>,helping the devs and becoming a platform for what it is now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had yet to make a major contribution to a open source lib but with my current experience and mini-contributions it for sure as hell gonna be a learning adventure I am thrilled to look up for.</p>
<p>As a part of my contribution to the community I&rsquo;ve made two open source tools&hellip;.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shagunattri/sub3num">sub3num</a> A sudomain enumeration tools for pentesters.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shagunattri/pwGen">pwGen</a> A mnml password generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these tools were my attempt to making tools for the open source community.</p>
<p>I plan on writing more tools and sharing them with y&rsquo;all till then keep em pull requests coming..</p>
