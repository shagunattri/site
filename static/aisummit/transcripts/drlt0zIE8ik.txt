improved their intake enrollments by 5x. >> All right. Now coming to our third uh AI product. It's called AI quality compliance specialist. And at the end I I'll bring together how all of these three come together and and create enormous impact. But the problem statement here was our students would be applying and uh you know there'll be admissions officers at every university or even our own quality compliance teams that would be checking for whether these docs are genuine, they are complete, whether they are eligible, is there any fraudulence in them etc etc and it would take weeks. So before you submit an application you check them it takes three four days after you submit an application it takes 6 weeks 3 weeks four weeks to get an offer. Once you get an offer then it takes a week to schedule an interview. Then you do that interview takes another week for the interview result to come. So it takes about six to seven weeks of the whole process. So we brought in AI quality compliance specialist. What this does is the moment you make an application the application is submitted instantly. The AI quality compliance specialist will check for whether the documents are genuine, whether they're eligible for this particular program and whether they are complete. And if all good, you get an instant AI offer. you get an instant offer and when you get this instant offer we integrated our AI interviewer. So in the offer letter now there is also the interview link. So imagine the process that used to take six to seven weeks for a student end to end to get a you know offer an interview and final offer now takes in a takes place in a couple of hours in just two hours or less than two hours you apply you get an instant offer there's an interview link you give your interview and AI will give you your result as well are you pass are you fail if you're doing good on X parameters on one or two parameters maybe relevance of your answers is good the depth of your answers is good maybe communication is a little weak or your language skill is a little weak if you fix on it you can come back and redo another interview and that is what we did with AI quality compliance specialist and then clubbing it with the AI interviewer right >> so what's really happening under the hood right quick zoom out on that three products one engine every student interaction flows through the same orchestration layer that you see here same pipeline same guardrails and same auditability whether it's a WhatsApp conversation, a document review, or of course an interview. And underneath all of that sits our verified data and policy. Let's do a demo. Let's really see what happens when you have Vasu within WhatsApp and how it answers your queries. Now, Wasu the AI counselor is both available one- on-one WhatsApp as well as within WhatsApp groups where we have multiple humans and agents talking to each other. So Wasu asked me what is you know I asked Vasu if you can if it can help me with shortlisting a university. It then gave me a rubric of my background. Why? Because essentially wants to personalize a short list for me. So I've asked for a computer science undergrad course. I'm from India. I'm going to the UK. I don't want it to you know restrict me in terms of intake date or of course in terms of last academic percentage that may be available. Vasu then generates a list of top five courses that are available for me. You can keep asking it for more information. I can ask it for another five, another five, another five. It'll keep giving me options that are ranked, right? Why ranked? because we want the best available universities to be avail uh to be available as choices for you. Vasu then also gives you a PDF of your top five choices with key information. What's the degree called? What's the location? Right now, of course, I want to refine this short list. Right? I have a particular score. Will that score hold for these universities? Let's refine, right? for an IS score of six. Vasu then further refineses this list and shares the subset where an IS score of six actually holds. Under the hood, Vasu actually pulls the top 40 universities that are available to you. Because we don't want our users to be overwhelmed, we don't show all 40 choices, but you can keep interacting with Vasu to get more and more information. Now I want to further understand and further refine if there is a particular scholarship amount that I can expect. Right? So I ask it for scholarships greater than say £2,000. Right? Vasu then further refineses the short list and makes the final list available to me. This is super critical for our partners because now they don't have to go go through a system an MI system any system basically India runs on Google sheets so no Google sheets for them and literally shows up the final short list that can be sent to a student you can have a live interaction between a counselor and a student reduced in time and a final university decided right in the first conversation Okay, so that was while acts like the agent orchestrator, it is not making the decisions itself. The decisions are being made by within the proprietary data of leverage. Right? Let's come down to the AI interviewer. Right? Let's get started. So say a student wants to give an interview. before we get there. So this is a system where for a university a student's applying or an a you know an education consultant is applying for the student in this form all we need to do is upload the documents. So we're uploading the passport their mark sheets their CV uh their grades consolidated mark sheet 12th mark sheet and at this point we don't have any form filling. All this needs is you click check eligibility and the the AI here is reading the documents calculating the grades on the fly. It's calculating whether semester wise mark sheet marks are adding up to the final marks. Is there any kind of fraudulence any vision related fraudulence that I can see and all this data gets filled automatically here. Here's a human in the loop. You're basically saying just verify if all these details have been fetched correctly if all good and just give us these two answers. Have you ever been refused a visa in the last 2 years and ever overstate your visa? And that's it. You click submit and now the AI is going and checking for eligibility and instantly the student gets an offer letter. This is an offer email that comes instantly to the student. And at this point now while the student has got the offer letter, they also have a link to do the interview. Right? So here click here to do your credibility interview. You can log in. You get an OTP on your email and before you start your interview, you get a platform demo to make sure everything's working fine. You'll ask some simple questions, your video, your audio, voice, everything's going fine, recording is running fine. And once the demo is complete, you basically start with your final interview. You get a set of instructions and answer the question. And now once you've completed this interview, look at the university, right? when the university logs in they have a whole list of you know hundreds of students who have completed their interviews and AI has shared you know so many interviews are for example in the green lane where they've completed the interview and the AI thinks they are green good to go well you can also go and review these questions right and how the interview went as you review them in the same platform they are now able to accept reject or ask the student to reinter this is how they go through the entire process from which would take six to seven weeks from applying and then you know getting an offer then interviewing getting a slot in a week doing the interview getting a result in another one two weeks now happens in a matter of two hours you apply you get an instant offer instant credibility interview link and the credibility interview also gets assessed by AI where you get the result also right after you finished your interview right so that's all these products in action for you and what's the impact we've been able to deliver we have delivered a 20x productivity gain 5x higher enrollment and 90% uh turnaround time reduction reduction in the end toend process right we've also saved 20,000 hours of interviewing and with Vasu we are now 24/7 on for our students and for our consultant partners in 27 countries 10,000 plus of them right and and now we are impacting hundreds of thousands of lives every year every month uh with LE AI. That's us. If you're interested in all the cutting edge work that we are doing at leverage, come build with us or, you know, you can write into us at aabsleedu.com and we'll be more than happy to have a chat and have you join our team. Right this point, any questions? Happy to answer any questions the crowd might have. Yes sir. So it's very interesting what you shared but at the end of the day everything becomes like a cookie cutter approach. So the ability to identify the right talent becomes everyone is using the tools. Students are preparing through AI. AI is preparing them for the interviews. interviews are conducted by AI. So bar for everyone has already gone high. So the personal touch the differentiator remains something to be solved for. I think it continues to go up. So that's just my dilemma. By the way, I have a teenager girl who is going through the process. So we gone for a very personalized consulting precisely for that reason. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Very very well said, sir. So uh as we imagine the process right we believe you've gone for a personalized consulting but imagine that one person how would that person have all the knowledge of 200,000 odd courses out there right or whatever opportunities are out there to keep themselves ab breast of all those opportunities to be able to give you the right advice I think they understand the framework really well they are experts at ensuring that while AI goes in and fetches all those answers for you. Of those big choices, five, 10 choices that you get, they are experts at telling you which is the right choice to pick for you, right? They are experts at telling you, you know, helping you manage the students anxiety, helping them manage the, you know, tough decision making. That is what human empathy, that is where human empathy comes in and that is something that AI cannot do. That is what we as humans can do. But where we are automating things is all the low-lever tasks. All the tasks which regard revolve around research which revolve around keeping ourselves ab breast of information about analysis. Even from an interview perspective the idea here is there are certain parameters you are trying to judge in an interview and you can automate that. Look at the flip side. When you are manually doing interviews and you have you know tens of thousands of students lining up you cannot interview tens of thousands of students. In fact, most of the educational institutions or even recruiters, job recruiters out there will not interview everyone. They will take a look at the resume. They will use some AI short list, create some, you know, smaller list and only be able to interview them. And even there probably they'll be like, "Sorry, there are too many interviews happening. We'll have to probably not, you know, let go of not interviewing many of them." Imagine what this enables democratization at scale where now all those 10,000 students are getting interviewed on stage one. So in fact I would argue that the human touch has become better. Now you are not only looking at a piece of paper and their resume you're also listening to them. You're also seeing their persona their profile their their actual who they are their personality right in your decision making. Be it for a university application be it for a job application anywhere. And I think that's what this is enabling at scale. Any other questions? Yes sir. So I understand the the part where you are helping shortlisting the universities and submitting the application but the second part where you're receiving the offer letter and interviewing is that a mock mock interviews or do you have real collaboration with the universities? both. We started out as helping students prepare for their interviews and what you just saw is an actual collaboration with universities where universities are using our systems for students or educational consultants to directly make applications into the platform and universities are able to issue instant offers. They are allow able to allow students to now do instant interviews as well. So we are doing both. This is production ready already live with universities being used in the real world with thousands of students. So I believe there will be very limited set of universities that you have tie up with or is it majority of? >> So uh today we work with more than 850 universities globally. Most of our university partners because the complex the journey is very complex for students especially those who are applying outside the country. Uh is where we have a majority of our university partnerships. Having said that uh we are also now uh uh helping students get to online uh courses uh done in India. So we are now working with about 50 odd universities that are offering online courses like uh you know courses in AI, ML uh or uh you know MBA along with a specialization in data science and things like that. >> Thank you and very interesting. I I I believe this has a lot of scope. >> Thank you so much. >> Yes. Yes ma'am. You have a question back there. So I wanted to understand the part about the AI interviews. Are you feeding a set of standard questions and answers and judging on the basis of that or is there any other criteria to evaluate the AI interviews? >> Sure. A very very good question. Thank you so much for asking ma'am. Uh so when we interview we basically work with any recruiter could be a job recruiter or a university or a school and we essentially try and understand the dimensions they're trying to assess a candidate on. For example, for a university those dimensions will be hey why are you interested in this university? Why are you interested in this course? Uh then what are your short-term long-term goals? Uh why are you uh uh you know how are you going to fund your education? Etc. etc. There could be seven eight different dimensions, right? And within each dimension, then we have hundreds of questions to ask, you know, somewhere the same dimension and then the AI is smart enough to say when you so every interview is randomized. We make sure that we are able to get you an assessment of the student on every dimension, right? Uh and as we get an assessment on every dimension, we make sure that every interview is randomized. So within a dimension, it could be any of the hundreds of questions that get asked. So the combinations are crazy in tens of thousands, right? So a simple a student getting the same interview again would probably happen in once in 10 to 10,000 to 100,000 students, right? And now once the interview is done, uh the AI is also checking by the way for fraudulence. So there are instances where someone might be looking at notes stuck to their computer or reading from somewhere. Uh so we track eye movement and you're able to check whether uh you know there is any kind of fraudulence happening. Are there more than one tabs open? uh are there more than one people in the room, more than one voices in the room? Um and and uh so yeah, a bunch of uh anti-fraud uh mechanisms also that are baked in already into the product. I hope that answers your question. Sorry, I can't Uh just a followup does the system actually I mean in the past did it reject candidates that were actually eligible for the course has that happened? >> So uh eligible from a when you say eligible from a qualification perspective but yes in the interview >> I mean qualitatively better. >> So uh what we do is we use a conservative approach. So we would rather use the AI as an autorejection mechanism than an auto approval mechanism. So we make sure that if someone has scored two on 10 or three on 10 or four on 10 is definitely rejected but someone who scored say six seven on 10 who's in the yellow zone is not rejected. There is a human in the loop who will look at that student or at max we will give them a reinter so that they get another chance. uh but yeah that's the approach we use. It's a conservative approach to make sure students are not rejected uh randomly. Uh it's only uh at max we will give them multiple interview sets as well. >> Okay. And just to add to our question what is the source of validation here like how you're validating your AI is working fine like still a human intervention would be required here. >> Sure. uh so what we've done is um because we conduct more than I think for specifically for this interviewing use case even for the quality compliance specialist everywhere what we do is uh we've been doing this for the last 9 years we have catered to 1 lakh 50,000 plus students so as we cater to them we would earlier 9 years ago start with manually looking at a lot of these documentation we have a whole database of all the fraudulent documents that we've caught uh versus actual documents and we've trained our AI on a lot of those uh you know uh parameters that we've had. Similarly, when it comes to interviews, as we do interviews, there's always a human in the loop that's giving the final decision on approvals. So, as a human in the loop says, oh, this is a you know, nrated student for example, but we are still rejecting for this reason. That becomes a feedback data point for us to go back and improve the AI uh assessment even more, right? So, it's a consistent feedback loop. And we've been doing this for the last two years now. This is not a new product. Uh so this has gotten really good. Uh now >> probably your stack is still learning. >> Could you repeat that? >> It's still learning from from humans only. >> It's still learning from humans. >> Yeah. So it it is uh it and I think that's the way you should always have a human in the loop. Uh to make sure like M said over there, a genuine student should never get rejected. working >> cool. Uh so I'm more interested on the fraud detection side. So why have you opted for uploading the documents instead of like getting them from some government database itself? >> Very good question and uh we do both. uh wherever there's a government database available say mark sheets available in uh you know digil locker or something or on verified university websites we will go and double check there itself and if it checks out there it's done uh the problem happens when there are students who probably graduated 5 years ago 7 years ago or from universities which are not covered in diger and we are also catering to over 27 different countries so there could be students coming from uh a Nigeria Ghana Kenya or a Nepal or a Sri Lanka or a you know Bangladesh or where not so uh we are also catering to all those uh students. So uh we have to use an approach where it's you know more than 70% of the students documents are not verifiable on a government database as of yet today. Okay. >> And which is where we need to be able to use other means uh to uh validate genuiness of documents. >> Got it. >> Right. There's no other questions. We'll wrap up. Okay. this we have one more question I'm going to ask the organizers we have time right >> okay >> thank you >> uh so we have different kinds of students like from the metro cities or from different countries as well so we have like different like kind of levels of the students so how you are just disintegrating like separating the students from different countries because they have some are much ahead of that uh level so how you are separating these kind of like some metro cities some different so >> I mean that's the idea of assessment right uh like I mentioned in the beginning of my speech talent is everywhere so let us not underestimate any talent that's in a tier 4 city they might be uh 10x better than someone in a you know in in a tier one city in India or even in a New York uh and our idea is to ensure that we match the right talent to the right opportunity so if there is a talented individual even in a tier four city in India uh and they know what they are doing and if we are able to assess it at scale we are actually democratizing education. So that's the idea of all these tools. they are able to essentially assess uh you know when an AI is conducting an interview they are able to ask the right set of questions and able to get the right you know assess the answers that are coming their way to be able to really understand for this particular course is this student going to be eligible and the same thing also gets used for even say job uh uh recruitment right so we also for example uh while we have many uh companies that use our product we at leverage do all our hiring completely through uh the AI interviewer And uh essentially the AI interview is smart enough to ask the right set of questions to assess the right skills and be able to you know very quickly tell us if a thousand people have applied for a particular role which are the top 30 40 that we should be speaking with and that's the role that AI has been able to do for us very well. >> So like my question was like suppose like some is getting in one or two interviews like getting out of 10 they are getting eight or nine and some are getting like less than five or four. So it will be both like on the same next interview they are getting same question or same type of things or or it will be change like >> it change every interview is randomized and it's different the same interview never repeats but the philosophy is the same if you understand a concept if I ask you a question like this or like this you know it's like it's we've all given exams like if you understand the concept you will be able to answer that question >> so AI will not label down for the like who is getting five or four or who's getting eight or nine or but it will be randomized for like next interviews as well >> correct Correct? Like the idea is not to uh is not to help someone cheat, right? The idea is to be able to assess whether they understand. >> But suppose like for like someone who is getting five or someone's getting eight or nine. So it might be like a different uh kind of level for them for who are getting. >> So what we do is we give them feedback on what particular pillar are you're not able to score well. So for example, there are six or seven dimensions. So we will say that you know your communication is good your language skills are good your problem solving ability has is you're scoring low on your problem solving ability right or it could be hey u we are not able to clearly assess how does this course relate to your goals right when we give that feedback then you know that okay this is what I need to work on more right you can prepare accordingly so you'll get feedback as well in these interviews >> okay thank you Yeah. All right. Thank you so much everyone. We are LE AI. Please write to us if you're interested in working with this cutting edge AI research team. Thank you. >> We are also exhibiting here in hall number six. >> Yep. One last question for you. >> Can we take that offline? Uh we'll just we'll just come and see you offline. Thank Thank you. So, booth number 271, hall 6. Thank you. >> [music] >> are [music] We would directly ask a question which kind of use cases you want to build. But here we work with them. We identified the processes which would be required to do this in call center which includes your propensity score which includes your lead scoring which includes your sentiments from the call center and we broke that down and built the use cases on the OS. So what happens it was a real time which was getting into the call center. So that's at a prototype stage. So now these agents are reused like if I have built a agent for early claim this agent one of the agent is also used in missselling. So when you have agentic force internally you can reuse the agent that is the reusing inside the organization we are not reusing externally across the organizations. I hope it was at design pattern level. It is not at the operating system level is what I understand. So what happens is yeah what happens is if I have to build use case by use case I again go through everything but when we say operating system there is a reason to that why we are saying yeah because operating system has become synonym to the traditional Linux Unix windows but anything which needs to operate at a system level like it's xerox and photocopy we say let's do xerox but actually activity is photocopy so this is a synonym but for AI what change we are bringing is at system level when you are operating There has to be single governed layer which will be at the kernel level and it will become richer and richer as time goes and we take pride to build it from India. There were a lot of opportunity to raise fund in US but we are taking pride to build it from here and we are getting good support from government of India as well on this and it will become richer and richer as time goes. Thank you very much. Thank you. I appreciate. Hello. Hi everyone. Good evening. So I am Shwetta. I lead marketing and branding at a startup called Hacktoskill. Uh we run innovation challenges and hackathons in partnership with several uh corporates and government bodies. So before we start and talk more about our product, uh can you can I get a quick show of hands of people who are from technical background or are currently maybe developers or engineers. Great. And rest of you are in uh different other fields I'm assuming marketing, healthcare and okay great. So uh before we start talking before I start talking more about our product when I started creating these slides this is one of the stats that I uh came forward. Yeah this is one of the stats that I uh came through that how 20 more than 27,000 startups are being founded every single day. Obviously the number can be here and there
