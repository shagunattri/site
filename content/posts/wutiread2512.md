The more you learn about marketing the more interesting it gets with insights into human psychology and the fusion of winnings customers with trust while upholding the values of the brand.

In a marketing function, it is easy to get lost in the sea of numbers and data from Google Analytics and other intent tools. Sourcing information from databases to cold-reach prospects with hopes to convert to one one-day. The days never gonna come if you keep doing generic stuff.

This post covers a lot of insights into how mature marketing teams work and the potential pitfalls of getting stuck in the initial stages of the marketing Continuum.

Better to focus on a market segment and solve that over spilling tea all over the place with no idea of what to do being stuck in the middle. Porter's Generic Strategies help understand how an organization should build strategies that cover competitive advantage across the chosen market.

Competitive strategies should target:
- Cost of customer acquisition and operations
- Differentiation in the segment
- Focus on the problem

It's interesting how character invention in your head can lead you to force yourself to do things that you're consciously afraid of doing. This technique should help build confidence if you can switch personalities/mindsets.

Hustle culture vibes tho but must work if done right.

### Product Management Insights from the week

- Your product is not simple enough and won't work if it needs documentation to use when users are stuck during the product journey. Products should be simple with room for users to explore and research on their own.
- Important to act first on customer insights over your hunches for solutions.

### Podcast Reccos
