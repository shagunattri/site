## About Me

Hiee, I'm shagun, I run this site to share blogs,pics and more(book reviews, music, guides), with insights on trending and insighful products.

I like to work at the intersection of technology and psychology.

My interests are in product management and building security products. I'm currently building a B2B product in the cybersecurity space for AppSecOps to optimize for better distribution, usage, adoption and accelerate growth for the ArmorCode Platform.

I now settle with ~~Arch Linux~~ a Mac for personal use and one to work. My setup details are covered [here](https://shagun.xyz/posts/setup/).

## This blog

Articles published on this site are digital snapshots of my learnings and thought while trying to do some wordplay all over the place.

This site covers:
- Technology
- Business
- PM
- People
- Books
- Cybersecurity

I write code at times. My projects are available on
