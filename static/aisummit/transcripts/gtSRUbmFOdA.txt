Applause. Applause. Please come. >> Ladies and gentlemen, honorable prime minister has arrived at Bharat Mandapam. Let's have a big round of applause. Honorable Prime Minister of India Shinarendra Modi who has arrived at Bharat Mandapam. This is a moment where everybody has been waiting for. Honorable Prime Minister here, ladies and gentlemen, may I please request you all to let's welcome him with a round of applause. Artificial intelligence is a question for many, but not today. Today we've all gathered here for the AI impact summit 2026. Namaskar distinguished guests, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the government and the people of India, it is my profound honor to welcome you all to AI impact summit 2026. I respectfully welcome the honorable prime minister of India Sharendra Modi GI whose visionary leadership has positioned India at the forefront of digital transformation and responsible AI innovation. It is with great pleasure that I extend a very warm welcome to his excellency Manuel Mcron will be joining us very soon. The honorable president of the French Republic. I also warmly welcome Shriwini Vhna, honorable minister of electronics and information technology, government of India. We are profoundly honored by the presence of heads of state, policy makers, global business leaders, researchers, innovators, and distinguished delegates from across the world. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this global platform for dialogue, collaboration, and innovation. Welcome to the AI impact Summit 2026. Distinguished guests, when a nation's resolve aligns with humanity's aspirations, technology becomes more than an instrument. It becomes a defining force of our time. Where once the pen-shaped revolutions, today code is shaping the future. Inspired by the visionary leadership of the honorable prime minister, this grand confluence of artificial intelligence is being guided by a confident and self-reliant India where data is not merely numbers but the heartbeat of the aspirations of millions where our goal is not competition through technology but building bridges of harmony across humanity. We now present a short film on the AI impact summit 2026. Thousands of years ago when power was measured by conquest, Bharat measured it by understanding. Stone rose into temples as disciplined geometry. Cities were planned as living systems. It was here that the void was given a name, Shuna, the zero. Before medicine became a science, life was understood as a system. The body learned stillness through yoga. The mind learned clarity. From Nalanda to the digital age, India has built shared tables [music] of learning. And when the world broke, this wisdom became a shield. Care crossed oceans with open hands. Because [music] when India heals, it heals the world. India reached for Mars carrying a billion dreams with it. Those dreams were built in the streets, the farms, and the palms of a billion hands. We built [music] a bridge for every nation to cross into the future. What began here became shared digital public infrastructure offered to nations as a partnership. Now the world stands at another threshold, the age of artificial intelligence. The world brings compute, servers, speed. This timeless civilization [music] brings the compass of Vasuva Kutumbakam. The world is one family. We placed AI at the heart of the human experience. Through the Aayushman Bharat digital mission, health records became portable. In our clinics, AI [clears throat] brings earlier diagnosis and better care to millions. In our fields, AI now speaks the farmer's dialect. In our schools, it becomes a personalized teacher for every [music] child. Through AI in our courts, justice found new clarity in the digital age. This is technology expanding human capability, not replacing it. When systems are designed for all, humanity moves forward. >> [music] >> not upward for a few but forward from many. As intelligence scales beyond borders, a larger responsibility emerges to ensure it remains [music] democratic, inclusive and accountable. This is AI for good. India does not [music] lead to stand apart. It leads to hold the circle together. ensuring that the global south has a voice as a co-author of the intelligence age from the creation of zero to the governance of intelligence. This is India. This is Bhat. As leaders, innovators and nations [music] gather for the India AI impact summit 2026. This is our moment to build a world of progress, prosperity and happiness for all time. That's AI impact summit 20126. Ladies and gentlemen, I now invite Shrihin Vashna, honorable minister for electronics and information technology, government of India to deliver the welcome address. >> [music] >> Namaskar. Honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi GI, Honorable President MRO, President Pamelan, respected heads of states and heads of government, honorable ministers, distinguished delegates, friends from the industry, media and dear students. A very warm welcome to India. Welcome to the first AI summit in the global south and of course the biggest AI summit so far. We have participation from 118 countries. Thank you all for making this summit a grand success. Friends, AI is a foundational technology. It is already transforming how we work, learn and make decisions. Our honorable prime minister Shindarendra Modi GI believes that the true value of technology lies in ensuring that its benefits reach the masses. Our prime minister's vision is to democratize technology, deploy it at scale, make it accessible to all. That's why in our country in India we are working on all the five layers of the AI stack. The first layer is the application layer. We sincerely believe that ROI will come from this layer and this is where the real benefit will flow to the masses in line with our prime minister's vision. That is we have that is why we are building real world solutions in healthcare, agriculture, education, logistics, design, financial services, every sector wherever the benefits can reach the masses. The second layer is the model layer and that's where the sovereignty comes in. While we understand that very large models will continue to push the frontier, we also understand and believe that more than 90% of the use cases can be addressed with smaller focused models. These specialized models will deliver greater value to our masses by addressing specific use cases at much lower cost. cost per token as well as overall cost of access. Our bouquet of sovereign models, many of which have been uh launched during this summit, they are all focused on multimodal and multilingual capabilities because we have a very diverse culture and we have hugely diverse linguistic uh scenario in our country. We have launched some of these summit uh some of these models during this summit and these models have stood their ground against frontier models on the points that matter most to us. The third layer is the compute layer and here once again our prime minister's vision of democratizing technology is clearly visible. We treat compute as a public good and that's why in a public private partnership we have created a common compute platform where we are providing access to 38,000 GPUs at a very affordable rate for our startups, academia, researchers and students and we will be adding another 20,000 GPUs to this common compute platform. The fourth layer is the infra layer with our talent pool and very trusted policies and recently our honorable prime minister has announced during the fin during the budget a very big policy shift towards getting the world's data to India to reside in India to be to be processed here and to and to deliver high value services to the entire world. We expect large investments in data centers in the coming months. The fifth layer is the energy layer. Friends, it's the commitment towards clean energy that our honorable prime minister has always shown. And that's why in our country today, more than 50% of the power generation capacity is from the clean sources, from renewable sources. Our visionary prime minister has recently reformed the nuclear energy sector also which is another very good sector for providing that base load of clean energy. We have a robust grid which has been practically rebuilt over the last one decade. In this context window in which this is the context window in which we are building our AI ecosystem. Stanford University uh AI index places India among the leading countries in AI adoption, AI talent and AI diffusion. But we are also conscious of the challenges which are facing our IT industry. And to mitigate it, we are working with the industry and academia to upskill, reskill and to build a new talent pipeline for this new intelligence age. While we harness the benefits of AI, we must also find collective solutions for mitigating the risks. By placing human safety and dignity at the heart of AI, we can move forward with conviction. Together, through this summit and through all the collective efforts and through the vision of our honorable prime ministers, Prime Minister, let us shape an AI future of the humans, by the humans, and for the humans. Thank you very much. >> Thank you honorable minister for the welcome remarks. And before I move on, ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to uh welcome honorable our distinguished guests. We have with us his excellency Manuel Macron, the honorable president of France who's joined us now. Please welcome him the previous host of AI Summit France. And it's indeed our privilege to welcome you here again this morning President Manuel Macron. Ladies and gentlemen, now I would like to welcome Shri Chandra Shakran, chairman of the Tata Group to the days to share his visionary insights on artificial intelligence. Please welcome Shri and Chandra Shakran, chairman Tata Group. Honorable Prime Minister Sri Narendra Modi, her excellencies, heads of state, policy makers and distinguished ladies and gentlemen. It is an extraordinary privilege to be here this morning and participate in this AI summit. India is a nation of AI optimists. Our enthusiasm is not surprising. Indians have witnessed the hugely ambitious digital infrastructure programs and what they can achieve. The largest digital identity system in the world covering 1.4 billion people. a digital payment interface that accounts for half of the entire world's transactions. Over the past few years, under our honorable prime minister's vision, India has treated AI as a strategic national capability aligning the full stack from chips to systems to energy and to applications through semicon India and India AI mission and most importantly the recent reforms such as the Shanti Act. for clean energy. We are building A at scale with trust, resilience, and long-term competitiveness. AI is a foundational technology that cuts across all industries. AI is nothing artificial. It is real because it learns from data and learns faster every day. And it is not based on any fixed rules. Third, AI can scale and it scales pretty rapidly. Putting all this together, AI to my mind is the next big infrastructure. It is the infrastructure of intelligence. It will have a very profound impact. Exactly the same way in the past other infrastructure changes have done. steam engines, electricity or internet. Our mission should be to make AI work for every individual and every citizen in this country. We should put the AI tools in the hands of the lost person in the country and in fact on the earth and that's the vision that we should all work towards. Couple of days ago we witnessed,500 rural women here in Bat Mandapam who had no background to computing, no background to digital tools in a matter of few hours could learn AI, could build products, could build marketing materials, campaigns all in front of a global audience. and they did it in four hours. AI will have huge impact on our public services delivery. It will have huge impact on enterprises around the world. Since I come from the background of IT industry, one word for the IT industry, it is in my opinion the biggest opportunity for the tech sector in in the IT industry because the IT industry's real value is the context an understanding of every enterprises business and technology landscape and make the right technology work inside the processes and the ecosystem, the supplier, customer and all the other connections an enterprise has. AI will expand that role much further. It is the opportunity to integrate AI and AI agents into workflows, reimagine proc processes and make it work and carry out the trans transformation so that every enterprise can realize realize the mode and realize its vision. Now I want to talk a little bit about the Tata group. At the Tata Group, we are adopting AI across the stack from silicon to systems to AI ready data centers to applications and a agents and we believe such a vision and such a journey is going to be extremely exciting and it will require us to work with worldleading partners in India and across the globe. I would like to make five points. The Tata Group is establishing India's first large scale a optimized data center purpose-built for the next generation AI training and inference. I'm very happy to announce that we have partnered with OpenAI to build the first 100 megawatt capacity which will scale to 1 gawatt. And we made an announcement with AMD yesterday where we will combine the world worldclass AI rack architecture with Tata's strengthen infrastructure engineering power and solution capabilities to create a sustainable highdensity capacity in India for global standards. The third we're already building a AI data insights platform. Minister Ashwini articulated the layers of data or data architectures. What we are building is totally based on diverse Indian data sets on top of the foundational models. So intelligence becomes available across the diversity of Indian contexts. And the fourth TCS and our other company Tata communication together we are building an AI operating system for industries. What we will do is to build agentic industry solutions for every industry. We are already well on that journey and we will work with partners to be able to launch it and take it to all enterprises around the globe. And finally again I want to thank the vision of our prime minister which made it possible for us to make a serious foray into chips and semiconductors. What we will do next is to build chips that are very domain centric which will be totally a optimized for every industry and we will first launch or work towards getting it ready for the automotive sector. So these are the areas that we are focused on. I think it is the time for promise to take action into practice so that we can deliver prosperity. Finally, in conclusion, I just want to say that we are standing here at a very defining moment. It is the age of abundant intelligence where the scarce resources are trust, stewardship and human capability. So let us send out a simple standard for the a decade. Capability with dignity, high impact for every watt of energy and progress with agency and collaboration. Thank you all very much. >> Thank you Mr. Enchandu Shakran for your forward-looking address. Excellencies, please join me in welcoming Mr. Dario Amote, CEO of Enthropic, a pioneer at the forefront of artificial intelligence as I request him to address the esteemed gathering. Please welcome Mr. Dario Amade. >> First, I want to thank Prime Minister Modi for bringing us together. The energy and ambition in this room and across India are incredible. I've been spending the last few days meeting with Indian builders and enterprises and the energy to build together here is palpable, unlike anywhere else. Um, this is the fourth AI summit we've held since the tradition was initiated at Bletchley Park back in 2023, which I still remember. And in those 2.5 years, the advances in the technology have been absolutely staggering. Along with those, the advances in the commercial applications and the societal and ethical questions around the technology have only grown more urgent. My fundamental view is that AI has been on an exponential for the la for the last 10 years um and as part of a sort of Moors law for intelligence and that we are now well advanced on that curve and there are only a small number of years for AI models surpassing the cognitive capabilities of most humans for most things. We're increasingly close to what I've called a country of geniuses in a data center. A set of AI agents that are more capable than most humans at most things and can coordinate at superhuman speed. That level of capability is something the world has never seen before and brings a very wide range of both opportunities and concerns for humanity. On the positive side, we have the potential to cure diseases that have been incurable for thousands of years, to radically improve humans health, and to lift billions out of poverty, including in the global south, and create a better world for everyone. On the side of risks, I'm concerned about the autonomous behavior of AI models, their potential for misuse by individuals and governments, and their potential for economic displacement. India has an absolutely central role to play in these questions and challenges both on the side of the opportunities and on the side of the risks. As a sign of our commitment, we just this week opened an office in Bengaluru and hired Ireina Gos who has spent who has spent three decades building businesses in India as our managing director for Anthropic India. We've also announced partnerships with major Indian enterprises this week including Infosys and others on the opportunities. One dynamic that we have observed is that technology and practices pioneered in India have historically set a standard for the global south and have helped to diffuse technology and humanitarian benefits through the global south. We're therefore partnering with, we have been partnering with for several months, nonprofits such as the Xstep Foundation, Prratham, and Central Square Foundation to use our models to advance digital infrastructure, education, agricultural efficiency, and health in the hopes of spreading AI's benefits across the global south, starting with India and diffusing out to the rest of the global south. We're also partnering with Karia and the collective intelligence project to build evaluations and metrics of our model claude's performance on India's many regional languages on practical and locally relevant tasks we'll benchmark like agriculture legal tasks and educational content on the risks India is the world's largest democracy and can be a partner and leader in addressing the global security and economic risks of the technology we'd like to work with India on testing and evaluation of models for safety and security risks in the tradition that was started by many global and national AI security institutes that have been stood up around the world. Even more, we see a particularly strong opportunity to work with India on studying the economic questions as part of the New Delhi Frontier AI impact commitments which we're excited to join. As part of our anthropic economic futures program and anthropic economic index, we publish statistical insights into how AI impacts jobs in the economy. We're excited to increasingly share this information, exchange information with the Indian government to share insights and inform evidence-based policym convene meetings with economists, labor leaders and policy makers to adjust to to to adapt to the economic impacts of AI. We believe that AI will greatly grow the economic pie including in India and the global south. But that because it is happening so fast, it may lead to a time of disruption and we need to work together between companies and the government to better manage that time of disruption and bring better prosperity smoothly to all. Um I in anthropic are very grateful to be part of all these efforts and I'm honored to be here and working on these questions with all of you. Thank you Mr. Dario Mote for that illuminating address. Ladies and gentlemen, it is our privilege now to welcome Shishundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google for the keynote address. We look forward to his insights on the evolving role of artificial intelligence. Mr. Sundel Pay. Namaste. Thank you, Prime Minister Modi and distinguished leaders. It's wonderful to be back in India. Every time I visit, I'm struck by the pace of change and today is no different. Back when I was a student, I often took the Coramandal Express train from Chennai up to Iay Karakpur. To get there, we passed through Vishaka Weisak. I remember it being a quiet and modest coastal city brimming with potential. Now in that same city, Google is establishing a full stack AI hub, part of our 15 billion infrastructure investment in India. When finished, this hub will house gigawatt scale compute and a new international subc cable gateway bringing jobs and cutting edge AI to people and businesses across India. Sitting on that train, I never imagined Visak becoming a global AI hub, just as I couldn't have imagined [clears throat] that one day I'd be spending time with teams figuring out how to put data centers into space or taking my parents for a fully autonomous car ride in San Francisco. Seeing a whimo right through my 83-year-old dad's eyes, I saw the progress in a whole new light. Of course, he said he'd be more impressed if it worked on India's busy roads. Still working on that one. Dad, the progress shows what's possible when humanity dreams big. And no technology has me dreaming bigger than AI. It is the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes. We are on the cusp of hyper progress and new discoveries that can help emerging economies leapfrog legacy gaps. But that outcome is neither guaranteed nor automatic. To build AI that is truly helpful for everyone, we must pursue it boldly, approach it responsibly, and work through this defining moment together. Why bold? Because AI can improve billions of lives, and solve some of the hardest problems in science. For 50 years, predicting protein structures was a grand challenge and a blind spot that stalled drug discovery. Deis Hassabis and his team at Google DeepMind asked an audacious question. How could we use AI to solve this? That question led to AlphaFold. This breakthrough didn't just win a Nobel Prize. It compressed decades of research into a database that is now open to the world. Today, over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries are using it to develop malaria vaccines, fight antibiotic resistance, and much more. And we are asking similarly bold questions across the scientific stack. From cataloging DNA disease markers to building AI agents that act as true partners in the scientific method. We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology. Take El Salvador where Google has partnered with the government to bring affordable AI powered diagnosis and treatment to thousands who could never afford to see a doctor. Or in India, where our work together is helping farmers protect their livelihoods in the face of monsoons. Last summer, for the first time, the Indian government sent AI powered forecasts to millions of farmers possible in part because of our neural GCM model. I see language inclusion as another exciting ambition. In Ghana, we are collaborating with universities and NOS's to expand research and open-source tools across more than 20 African languages. We need this bold thinking in more places to tackle more problems across health, education, economic opportunity, and more. Technology brings incredible benefits, but we must ensure everyone has access to them. We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity. I mentioned our VISAC investment and we have others in Thailand, Malaysia and more. We're also building a vast network of subc fiber optic cables including four new systems between the US and India as part of our America India connect initiative announced yesterday. Responsibility also means navigating profound economic shifts. AI will undeniably reshape the workforce, automating some roles, evolving others, and creating entirely new careers. 20 years ago, the concept of a professional YouTube creator didn't exist. Today, there are millions around the world. Training is crucial. We have trained 100 million people in digital skills, and our new Google AI professional certificate will help people master AI in their jobs available globally. Finally, trust is the bedrock of adoption. We have created tools like Synth ID used by journalists and citizen fact checkers globally to help verify the authenticity of the content you read and see. But no matter how bold we are or how responsible, we won't realize AI's full benefits unless we work together. Governments have a vital role that includes as regulators, setting important rules of the road and addressing key risks and importantly also as innovators bringing AI to public services that improve lives and accelerating adoption of these technologies for people and businesses. There are glimmers of this from around the globe. From the Ugandan government using AI and satellite imagery to locate priority areas for electrification to getting potholes fixed for residents more efficiently in Memphis, Tennessee by using AI scans of road surfaces from buses. Tech companies must also step up building products that boost knowledge, creativity, and productivity to help people achieve their dreams. And we also need companies of all sizes thinking about this, harnessing AI to innovate and transform their businesses and sectors and to scale up and empower workers. We have the opportunity to improve lives at a once in a generation scale. I know we have the capability to do this and looking at the leaders here today, I believe we also have the will. Now we must do the work together. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Sundep Pachai for that warm and insightful address. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great honor to invite his excellency Antonio Gutier, Secretary General of the United Nations to present his address, a global leader championing peace, cooperation, and sustainable progress. Please join me in giving him a warm welcome. Prime Minister Modi, thank you for your kind invitation and congratulations for India's leadership organizing the first AI summit in the global House [applause] meeting in India has special meaning. It brings this conversation closer to the realities shaping much of the world because the future of AI cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires. Last year, the UN General Assembly took two decisive steps. First, creating an independent international scientific panel on AI. And I'm happy to announce that the panel has now be appointed. These 40 leading experts from across regions and disciplines embody a clear message. AI must belong to everyone. We must replace hype and fear with shared evidence and close knowledge gaps. I urge member states, industry and civil society to contribute to the panel's work. Second, launching a global dialogue on AI governance within the United Nations where all countries together with the private sector, the academia and the civil society can have a voice. We need guard rails that preserve human agency, human oversight, and human accountability. And the first session of the dialogue in Geneva in July will give every country and every stakeholder a voice to align efforts, uphold human rights and prevent misuse and to advance our common safety measures, the foundation of interoperability that builds trust across borders for regulators and businesses and trust and turns compatibility into opportunity. Your discussions here will culminate in the global dialogue. But without investment, many countries will be logged out of the AI. AI must be accessible to everyone. That is why encouraged by the general assembly of the United Nations, I'm calling for a global fund on AI to build basic capacity in developing countries, skills, data, affordable computing power and inclusive ecosystems. Our target is 3 billion US. That is less than 1% of the annual revenue of a simple single tech company. A small price for AI diffusion that benefits all include businesses building AI. I'm pleased that member states have responded to my call to form a global network for exchange and cooperation on AI capacity building in developing world. AI must benefit everyone. Done right, AI can advance sustainable development goals, accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, expand learning opportunities, strengthen food security, bolster climate action and disaster preparedness, and improve access to vital public services. But it can also deepen inequality, amplify bias, and fuel harm. As AI's energy and water demands sore, data centers and supply chains must switch to clean power and shift costs to vulnerable communities. We must invest in workers so AI augments human potential, not only replaces it. And AI must be safe for everyone. We must protect people from exploitation, manipulation, and abuse. No child should be a test subject for unregulated AI. Excellencies, the message of this summit is simple. Real impact means technology that improves lives and protects the planet. So let's build AI for everyone with dignity as the default setting. Thank you. Thank you his excellency Antonio Gutes for your gracious address. Distinguished guests, it is my profound honor now to invite honorable president of France, His Excellency Emanuel Mccron to address the August gathering. Let's extend a warm and respectful welcome to his excellency Emanuel Mcron. Mr. Prime Minister Dearendra Modi, head of state and government, ministers, ambassadors, CEOs, ladies and gentlemen, namaste. Thank you very much for welcoming us in this magnificent city in this magnificent country and it's great to be back after my 2024 state visit for this artificial intelligence impact summit hosted by you Mr. Prime Minister and I I want to start with a story. 10 years ago, a street vanor in Mumbai could not open a bank account, no address, no papers, no access. And today the same vendor accepts payments on his phone instantly. instantly for free from anyone in the country. That is not just a tech story. That is a civilization story. And India built something that no other country in the world has built. A digital identity for 1.4 billion people. a payment system that now processes 20 billion transactions every month. A health infrastructure that has issued 500 million digital health ids. Here are the results. They call it the India stack open interoperable sovereign. That dear friends is what this summit is about. We are clearly at the beginning of a huge acceleration and you perfectly described it during your interventions. But let me just recap during one year what happened last year when France and India co-hosted the AI action summit in Paris. We set a global guiding principle for a technology that would transform our societies and our economies. We say then artificial intelligence will be an enabler for our humanity to innovate faster to to disrupt healthcare, energy, mobility, agriculture, public services for the good of mankind. Both of us, we do believe in this revolution. One year ago, the landscape started to shift. The US announced Stargate. China launched Deepseek. AI has become a major field of strategic competition and big tech got even bigger and some a lot of them are in this room and still accelerated during the last year. AI, GPU, chip tensions are now directly translated in geopolitical and macroeconomic terms. Sometime for the best, sometime for the worse, I have to say. But clearly one year ago, we demonstrated something else. A Germany from any quarter is not a fatality. There [snorts] is a path for innovation, independence and strategic autonomy. And this path I'm convinced is one of the countries like France and India must take together. And we have already achieved a lot. If we speak about models, you perfectly describe the acceleration and the diversity of these models. India made a deliberate sovereign choice SML small language models task specific designed to run on a smartphone and India built the first government founded AI and deployed 38,000 GPUs at the cheapest rates to every startup in the country as you perfectly described Mr. Minister, [snorts] we took a complimentary path. We invested in European large large language models. Mistral founded in Paris a little bit more than two years ago is now valued at 12 billion euro backed by Dutch leader SML, German SAP and French CMS GM serving over hundreds of major clients all over the place in Europe and elsewhere. They announced last week a new investment in data center in in Sweden and a new acquisition of COB building an actual European AI cloud. India chose granular and smart and Europe chose sovereign and scaled but both chose independence and both were right. And this is as well the cooperation with LLMs coming from the US and through cooperation but cooperation based on mutual respect and independence which could pave the way for progress. After the model of the infrastructure you just described all the infrastructure made by a lot of large companies in India and all of us we are building new infrastructure computing capacity. One year ago in Paris, we announced 109 billion dollars in AI investments and we are delivering this project with a lot of data centers 58 billion euro in 2025 powered by our decarbonated nuclear energy with a great asset and this is very important indeed to have low carbon and available energy. Last year, France exported 90 terowatt hour of lowcarbon energy and pilotable energy is a huge opportunity to build faster and bigger data center. At the European level, 200 billion euro have been committed with the arrival of the Alisok exascale supercomput key component of our AI factory ambition shared with Netherland and Greece and we share the computer with them. models, infrastructures, talents. India trains hundreds of thousands of AI engineers every year. With 500,000 engineers, India has the second largest developer community in the world. In France, we are doubling the number of AI scientists and engineers trained. And with now more than 1100 AI startups thriving in France, creating dozens thousands of jobs. Armaton AI partnering with do gradium for voice AI poolside ash hugging face I could quote the race of these unicorns and large caps and this is clearly one of our strengths in quantum computing the next frontier France is not placing one bet we are placing four four technologies four French companies Pascal Pandela Alison Bob Quabi and one ambition to make Europe a quantum power which is also the ambition of ami labs advanced machine intelligence labs from our dear Yanl for frontier research the smartest AI is not the most expensive it is the one built by the best people and for the right purpose models infrastructure talents capital and adoption. This is where the Indian model is truly revolutionary. Providing solutions for everyone in the country from 200 million of Indian farmers in their own dialect to travel advice for 400 million of pilgrims or AI diagnostics for rural clinics all running on India's digital public infrastructure. Open rails, near zero costs, adoption is key and being inclusive is key. In Europe, our AI factories optimize energy grids, transform logistics, reinvent healthcare administration, and we are proving you can build a competitive AI industry while protecting your citizens data. And opposite to what some misinformed friends have been saying, Europe is not blindly focused on regulation. Europe is a space for innovation and investment, but it is a safe space and safe spaces win in the long run. I'm sure of that. Now, the point of this summit was not only to say let's do more. It was to say let's do better together. AI may be a powerful accelerator of productivity and a major shift for labor markets. This is why access to AI for all is critical. France and India share a common vision. A sovereign AI used to protect our planet and to foster prosperity for all in health. We launched the in the indoor French institute for AI in health. A partnership between Sburn's brain institute and MS Delhi and the partnership between ash and sanjent research institute in Bangalore will use AI to transform hospital administration as well. in language. We join we jointly launched current AI for sustainable and sovereign AI access and this year we announced an open hardware tool for translation into Indian languages and dialects because AI that doesn't understand dialects is not AI for all and this is why we do endorse this initiative for diversity in language in sustainability. Our coalition for sustainable AI now has more than 200 supporters. Today with India and UNESCO we launch an international challenge for sustainable AI models. Last year in Paris we called it action. This year in Delhi we call it impact. But the real name is simpler. AI together. AI and digitalization will be a key theme for the months to come and a key theme for the Africa forward summit we will cause with Kenya and Nairobi in May. The continent, the African continent with the youngest population that will double in 25 years deserves the best digital tools. And at a time when tensions are ra rising, there is an increased sense of urgency to direct all our digital tools [snorts] toward this inclusive approach and in order indeed to be strong here in India but to be strong as well on the African continent and let's focus all together towards bridging rather than dividing, creating rather than destroying, sharing rather than taking. France intends to use its G7 presidency to foster that vision. I know Mr. Prime Minister that India will do the same through your bricks presidency. No country is bound to serve only as a market where foreign companies sell their models and download the citizens data. No country. One of our G7 priorities will be as well children's protection against AI and digital abuse. You just mentioned it, Mr. Secretary General. There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world. Our platforms, governments, and regulators should be working together to make internet and social media a safe space. This is why in France we are embarking on a process to ban social networks for children under 15 years old and we are committed here in this journey with a lot of several European countries being present here today. Greece, Spain, I know Mr. Prime Minister, you will you will join this club and this is a great news that India will join such an approach in order to protect child, children and teenagers. And we stand ready to take all necessary actions to ensure that our young citizens are truly safe and wish to engage with all willing partners to make this vision happen for all. And this is a new coalition of willings in order to protect our children and teenager. Protecting our children is not regulation as well. It is civilization. To conclude, the message I have come to convey is what is that we we are determined to continue to shape the rules of the game and to do with our allies such as India because we believe in core shared values, science, rule of law, global balance, efficient multilateralism, innovation for the benefit of all. Now is the time to channel our forces toward what what works. Concrete action and solutions that make AI more sustainable, efficient, and accessible. Targeted funding to leverage talents and creativity. Appropriate rules to prevent abuse and protect all our citizens. Strong partnerships that help build new AI solutions more safe and more sustainable. I want to thank all the governments and business leaders present in this room and engage in this journey. I know your goodwill and all your commitment in order to deliver this concrete results. We do believe in innovation but we do believe in a better place in a better world as well. And I don't believe one second it's uncompatible. And let me say one more thing about partnerships because this is not a two-player game. Last week, India and the UAE announced a joint AI partnership, a supercomputing cluster, shared data centers and innovation corridor. And India brings the engineers and the frugal models and the Gulf brings the capital and the infrastructure and together they build faster that Aether could alone. France knows this equation well. With UAE we engaged and commit they committed billions of euro for innovation and data centers in our country and this partnership create more value together. This is not dependency. This is intelligent convergence between governments with companies large caps startups and this is clearly this intelligent convergence which can provide results. The old word said you compete or you lose. The new world says you connect or you fall behind. And I started with a story about a street vendor in Mumbai. 10 years ago, the world told India that 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy. India proved them wrong. Today, some say AI is a game only the biggest can play. That you need $400 billion dollars to be in the race. That nothing can exist between the two blocks. India, France, Europe, together with our partners, those who believe in our approach, companies, governments, investors might have a different way. The money race is important and we cannot discount it. But the outcomes and real value creation for our population is even more. The future of AI will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, technology with humanity. And India and France will help to shape this future together. And the journey has just begun. Jho, thank you. Thank you his excellency Manuel Mccron for your visionary address and for strengthening the spirit of international cooperation in shaping the AI powered future.
