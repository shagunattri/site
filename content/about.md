## About Me

Hi, I'm Shagun - Associate Product Manager at [Sennovate](https://sennovate.com) building [Sennovate+](https://plus.sennovate.com/).

My interests are in product management and building security products. I'm currently building a B2B product in the cybersecurity space for Identity and Access Management(IAM) and Security Operations Center(SOC) categories to optimize for better distribution and accelerate growth for Sennovate.

I now settle with ~~Arch Linux~~ MacBook Air M1 for office work at this moment. My setup details are covered [here](https://shagun.xyz/posts/setup/).
