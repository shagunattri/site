## Hi.

```console
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "sp3ppr"
University = SRM Institute of Science and Technology
```

I'm Shagun, and I go by **sp3ppr** on the Internet. I'm a Compsci student.
My primary interest is information security and love contributing to opensource projects.
I have great interest in GNU/Linux. After a long time of distro-hopping, I now settle with Arch Linux.

### The existence of this blog

The most important characteristic of people is their ability to think. The original intention of blogging was to save electronic snapshots of their thinking. Of course, a variety of documentation tools or simple text editors can also record at any time, choosing to build a personal website is nothing more than to satisfy the paranoia of technology enthusiasts.

But if you think about it, every article published on the website is different from the thought fragments you just wrote down. It must be sorted and summarized, it must be readable, and even have practical value for yourself or others.

The original purpose of the site was not to show off knowledge, but to record ignorance.

The more people know, the more ignorance they will find. It â€™s a great pleasure to have a wider world to explore!


I write code at times. Take a look at my projects on
