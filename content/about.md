## Hi.

I'm Shagun,a Compsci undergrad student.

My primary interest is information security,love contributing to opensource projects and participating in CTFs.
I have great interest in GNU/Linux. After a long time of distro-hopping, I now settle with Arch Linux.

## The existence of this blog

The most important characteristic of people is their ability to think. The original intention of blogging was to save electronic snapshots of their thinking. Of course, a variety of documentation tools or simple text editors can also record at any time, choosing to build a personal website is nothing more than to satisfy the paranoia of technology enthusiasts.

But if you think about it, every article published on the website is different from the thought fragments you just wrote down.

I write code at times. Take a look at my projects on
