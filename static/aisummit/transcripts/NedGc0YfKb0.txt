touched or have the potential to touch a billion lives or more. May I now invite our distinguished panelist and our session chair and moderator Dr. Dr. Rajin Pratab Gupta, chairman Academy of Digital Health Sciences and former adviser to Union Health Minister, a global thought leader shaping digital health ecosystem and he is the chair of the global commission for 21st century healthcare responsible for designing health system which was launched on the sidelines of the UN high level general assembly on 15th December. Mr. Anish Chopra the first chief technology officer of the United States who demonstrated to the world how technology can be integrated into national healthcare systems and I'm very lucky to host him for the second time after 15 years. Dr. Sanil Kumar Bernwal CEO National Health Authority leading one of the world's largest digital health public infrastructures and healthcare. Dr. Anander, chief AI officer at Weldoc, a pioneer in clinical AI and digital therapeutics, transforming chronic disease care. Mr. Manish chief operating officer of the Mayo Clinic platform, advancing datadriven, globally scalable medical innovation. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a rare convergence of policy platform clinical AI. I request Dr. Rajin to take it forward. One more. One more. >> We'll start in a minute. >> Good afternoon. >> Good afternoon. >> Good afternoon. >> Thank you. Thank you. You know when we say empowering billions and sitting amongst those people who have already touched between 1.4 to 6 billion lives these are actual people who have already done there is no theory talk here there's actual implementation and I thank the AI summit organizers especially Dr. Rabishek Singh, CEO of India and the mighty team for organizing this wonderful conference and we know that we're talking of a topic that is unprecedented unpreented in scale unpreented in scope. I'm not going to take much time on putting the uh you know prelude to this talk but we know for sure that as ABDM we have put up the digital health system. Now we need to use that system to empower a billion plus people. That's a humongous task. But you know when we have such a task with no precedent, there is no precedent to have implemented such a system at scale anywhere. And we also know that if you look at the world, America innovated first in the system. Europe regulated first. India reach scale first. So we have to see how the world has moved in terms of digital health. I'm very lucky to have with me a distinguished panel someone whom I have respected a lot for what he has achieved Mr. Anish Chopra and we have seen him what he has done to the world he has taught the way you use technology for health so Anish given your global experience given what you did for United States what's your message to India which is trying to reach 1.45 45 billion people with digital health. >> Well, first of all, thank you so much for moderating and it's an honor to join you on this panel with my wonderful colleagues. Uh 15 years ago, President Obama visited India and I had the pleasure of introducing him to Nandan and to uh Sam and all the legends of India. Uh and after learning about Adhar and digital public infrastructure, he had one word in response, leaprog. that in many ways India was positioned to leapfrog what we had worked uh in the uh American governmental systems to to think about what it would be like if we could actually build a sense of abundance and to give access to everybody to high-quality information and service and I think today the message is very much the same. The theme of AI impact summit is the right theme which is to move towards democratizing access to highquality health care for everyone empowering uh individuals with their information and the tools that can help them make sense of it at every step of their health journey. My message is one of open collaboration. uh as India uh looks to scale these technologies uh my hope is that the underlying data standards and the information architecture can be exported not only in the global south but around the world so that they can empower everyone in a similar way and throughout this discussion I think we're going to get into the heart of that matter but at the moment those as me said at the beginning the fragmented pieces of health information that need to be aggregated longitudinally in in order to help understand what is the right next step in your health journey. Manisha is going to share with us what he's done uh to make this available at a massive scale with the Mayo platform as you'll hear as well from Anand on the tools to help people manage their diabetes. This is only going to get better and I'm hopeful with your leadership we can do this together. >> Thank you Anish uh for setting the context. Very well done. I think you should have been the chair. Nevertheless, moving to Dr. Sunil Bernoval. Dr. Bernoval with 860 million abhaindies. Do we have a precedent? No. And we know that you know this entire AI summit overly get focus on health. Every time you see everyone is walking and talking the health session. I don't want to put you under pressure but for sure the expectation runs high. So how do you wish to boost the adoption of ABDM and its associated networks that you're building? what's the plan? How you going to leverage AI? Yesterday we saw my former boss launching two big initiatives both and say what next? >> So thank you. Uh it's wonderful to be in the panel which is discussing billion health records and it's uh indeed a uh you know privilege to be part of this journey where India is aspiring to actually leverage AI at population scale. What good thing has happened uh with India is a creation of a digital public infrastructure in form of iceman bhar digital mission and you mentioned it correctly the foundation has been created architecture is in place we have a system by which health systems can talk to each other it can be interconnected so the there is a platform which is open, interoperable and there is a architecture which is federated. With this in place we see there is no challenge technologically to scale any AI solution to a large population like ours 1.4 billion. Now where the challenge lies and that is what Rajendra G has just mentioned. How do we create awareness and enabling environment by which people just on board on to this system they get uh this ABDM gets adopted across the facilities across the professionals and people start demanding digital health records. Today we have 860 million Aha ids created for our citizens but there are only 88 million 880 million health records uh linked to this aa ID that clearly shows one person will have many uh more than one health records but the data shows on an average one ABA ID has one or 1.00 001 health records that shows how much work we need to do more to link health records on this on this architecture. This is possible if we really make adoption very easy for the health facilities and for that there are methods by which we are enabling uh adoption of uh ABDM. One is you know create a mechanism by which we actually incentivize the hospitals to come on the integrated system. Right now as uh Anish also mentioned we have a quite fragmented health care system. It's a lying in one hospital, one facilities, episodic uh you know uh incidences, treatments and here is the case where this all can be interconnected. They can talk to each other based on you know consent mechanism with a very secured uh you know system in place and this we can one we are doing some kind uh one we are running a scheme which is for digital health incentives where we incentivize per record creation which many hospitals can take advantage of. Second, we also want to uh you know reduce the friction which a person has with the hospital and that we are reducing through know applications like a scan and shares voicetoext uh you know applications where the patient doctors interactions can be completely uh you know effortless and this can directly create a standard health records. So this is one and then also making hospital uh facilities professionals and the individual aware of the advantages in the future they will have. Patients can uh see the advantage because the whole system is centered focused on patient. Every time they go to the hospital or the any other facilities they get their electronic health record linked to their Aha ID. over a period of time they can generate longitudinal health records which will help them in many ways. It can actually alert them against you know disease. It can predict the future uh health of the person and therefore he can be very cautious. It can also allow the doctors in the next visit to have a better diagnosis and therefore a better treatment. So this all are possible and we are trying to make the whole system aware of the advantage and it was rightly said we have met the infrastructure railroad is ready the trains have to run and we need to get more trains to run on that so that the people who are making the journey the citizens who are making the journey have the seamless experience. So that is how we are trying to reach out to billion plus population >> and Dr. Sunil under your leadership I can tell you not just the train but the first bullet train will be the digital bullet train I'm sure about that so Anand coming to you where most of the people think that AI analyzes your you know records in your case you lead to better outcomes that's the wonderful thing you have done you become father at a very young age a father of digital technology which people re now what's your message to India when it comes to adding value to ABM your experience of what you did at weld and what innovations you would prescribe. >> Yeah, first of all, Rajin, thank you for your friendship and for your leadership on this panel and it's such an honor to be with all of you guys. Uh really appreciate it. Um for those of you who uh may not know me, um I'm a chief I serve as chief AI officer of WDOC, but I'm a type two diabetes patient myself and many many years ago I was inspired by my own condition to say there's got to be something we can do with digital health. When you think about the data continuum, while we talk about data fragmentation at the national and international level and then we talk about data fragmentation within the health systems, I'm talking about data fragmentation at the N equals one person level. So think about it. There's data, information, knowledge, action, and outcomes. This is the data value chain. Okay? The data is necessary. It's the first domino that needs to fall in order to extract value. Okay? So as a patient I use the acronym of metals. Okay. M is medications. I need to manage my medications throughout the day and I may be on a cocktail of medications if I have diabetes and hypertension and something else. Okay. E is education. There's educational content that I may want to consume. And it could be in the uh form of courses. It could be in the form of me reading, watching a video, uh understanding the effects of hypoglycemia, things like that. D is diet. D is diet and my diet is very different than anybody else's diet because it's my diet. Okay? So there's a level of personalization. A is activity which is both sleep and exercise. L is labs things I can measure. Quantitative measures means my blood pressure my blood glucose my weight my LDL cholesterol things like that. And then lastly S is surveys and symptoms. I'm feeling tired. I'm feeling shaky. I'm feeling sweaty. feeling shortness of breath if I have congestive heart failure. So I as a patient have to manage all of those vectors simultaneously throughout the day, throughout the week, throughout the year. And there's this small thing called life that gets in the way every now and then. So we ask a very simple question. Can we empower through proper clinical guidelines uh evidence-based guideline guardrails? Can we empower AI agents to help a patient manage these multiple things that they need to do? Okay, I'm sitting at a restaurant and my glucose is 228 migs per deciliter. What should I eat? How much insulin should I take? So now you have these agents that are working alongside that individual patient and the instructions they're getting are on literally I call it Google maps for a patient. Okay, Google Maps doesn't wait till you're 40 kilometers off track before it tells you to make a turn. As soon as you're off track, it says, "Hey, make a U-turn at the next place and come back." Right? Why can't we do that for health? And so what we did at Weldoc was we said let us build let us build an AIdriven platform that gives the turnbyturn instructions to a patient who may be hypertensive and diabetic who may be heart failure and diabetic whatever the combination is but clinical guidelines are there to help train the models and then we power those models with data that person's data okay I get I for me to get an SMS saying oh you're diabetic you better lose weight I know that I don't need SMS to tell me that, right? But if I'm constantly suffering from hypoglycemia, maybe the thing to tell me is, hey, I noticed a trend. Well, these are the three things you may want to do to avoid it. So your notion, doc, of doing prediction. We're not we're very good at treating acute care. In the US, sadly, we'll pay you $100,000 to cut off your foot, but we won't pay you $10 a month to go get your foot examined for uh diabetic foot ulcers. We're very good at acute care. We have to use AI to shift that focus to prevention. And you use AI to then do prevention, prediction. And you know what, Rajin, the outcomes we're talking about, we're talking about a 2 to three point delta in hemoglobin A1C. you know that that's a huge huge huge seven times what the FDA requires for a new drug just by the patient doing the things that they should do and the doctor is getting that the doctor doesn't want to be bombarded with the data can you imagine that good god that's the last thing that they want the doctor is getting the information and knowledge to say huh this is what's happening with that patient let's talk about this when we meet either in a tele medicine consult or whatever so you're bringing the doctor and the patient closer together. They're standing on technology shoulders and they're reaching further. And that's the kind of outcomes whether it's a 12 millimeter drop in systolic blood pressure or a six or seven point shift in BMI. You're going to the root cause. I'll say this tongue and cheek, but I'm dead serious. The blockbuster drug of this century is the engaged patient. It's the engaged patient. If they do what their doctor has told them to do and they have the tools to empower them, that's how they get the outcomes. >> Thank you, Anand. You know, if you if you heard the term software as a drug 15 years back, you'd be shocked, but this man did it. So, this is Anandir. Now, moving from this data to data platform. Manish Goyel is the chief operating officer of Mayoc Clinic platform. Mayo Clinic for 160 years has been the number one hospital system. Manish, we are moving from hospital platform to data platforms. What's the relevance of what you do to India? And with regard to ABM, we'll be very happy because our co is sitting here. >> Yeah, there you go. Um so first of all yeah I want to um echo what um Anand said thanks for bringing us all together. I think this is a fun conversation and um and I think as we get beyond the prepared comments we we're going to have a little bit of more fun because I don't think we always agree and that's an important concept. Uh I just want to define platform for for uh everybody's sake. oftentimes we use that term, but at Mayo Clinic we use it very specifically, which is it's not a piece of technology. It's a it's a way of operating. It's a it's a commitment that you're going to contribute something into into a body and then take something out. So, it's an implied contract that you're buying into and it's an important concept um around why we call it platform. So, I just want to talk about three different things. one historical Mayo Clinic what we're doing with platform and and the last is why because that why is the most important thing. So Mayo Clinic as you just articulated has been um uniquely positioned as one of the leading hospital systems globally because we practice complex integrated medicine. When you come to Mayo Clinic you get multiple specialties that uh evaluate your condition that create a unique integrated diagnosis. Um, that's why 32% of all cancer patients that come to Mayo Clinic, we change their diagnosis. That should give you pause because that's a really large number. Um, uh, we've been a three shield operation for 160 years. So that means we have a research institution. Uh, we do a lot of translational research. Um, we have two medical schools and then we have three sites in the US where we see patients from 135 different countries. uh in all 50 states. Um we're considered a tertiary quatinary center uh because we see a lot of complex patients. We're one of the largest whole organ transplant organizations in the world. Um why do I share all that? That is the foundation of Mayo Clinic. The other things about the culture of this organization is that everybody at Mayo Clinic is salaried. We don't have uh physicians that come in as con consultants. Everybody is salaried. Every single individual from the the cook in the kitchen to our exec CEO, everybody gets the same salary bump every year. None of us have variable compensation. Those are important concepts because it sets the culture of the organization and that is that the needs of the patient come first. If you pull somebody from the front line and pull them on what the core value of Mayo Clinic is, it will be that. if you pulled a business person around how they make decisions around the needs of the patient. So I just want to set the foundation for who we are for for a second and then I'll I'll I'll definitely answer your question. The thing with platform that we created five years ago was how do we impact billions of lives? How do we enable sharing? How do we enable impact at a at a global scale? So Mayo Clinic's been on this journey for six years where we've digitized a 100% of our data over the last 40 years. We haven't gone older than that, but we've gone 40 years of clinical history. Today that's about 8 million patients and 30 pabytes of data. That's a massive amount of data that we have. Uh a lot of it pre-diagnosis. And that becomes really important to Anen's point. If we can get ahead of any diagnosis in current form, which is you exhibiting a symptom, then we can actually get ahead of the problem. So at Mayo, we have over 300 algorithms that are actively running on patients walking in the door that do things like asymptomatic diagnosis for cardiovascular condition or uh determining precision medicine or uh determining the right uh therapeutic pathway. Those were important concepts as to as to the why but digitizing the data wasn't enough. We said how do we get to in order to get to billions of u patient impact we needed to expand that scope. So we've gone around the planet and identified leading academic institutions to partner with us. So we today have seven other institutions that have agreed to do that same thing organize their data but share it in a deidentified federated architecture. So we have about 55 million lives across the globe representing 40% of the top 10 institutions. The number one systems in Canada, South America, Israel, Korea, Singapore, three countries in Africa and uh and uh later this quarter I hope to announce our partner in India. So so now when you do an analysis, when you do training, when you do analytics, you're doing it on a global population. And you're no longer doing it in North American population as has been the norm in healthcare which is you test it on a North American or European population and then you throw it out into the world not worrying about the fact that it will likely not work in large percentage of the population. So we're getting ahead of the problem and for the first time in our lives we can do that. I just want to end with the why. So if you can diagnose a patient that would have otherwise had a fatal uh cardiovascular condition 10 years, 12 years, 15 years before they have any symptom because we can do that now by looking at an ECG that a well-trained cardiologist cannot but a machine can. That's impact. And if you can do that at Mayo Clinic, but then take that same algorithm and deploy it in a community site in rural Nigeria, that's global impact. That's those are examples. Other examples are we're actually taking all this data and and rethinking clinical trials. The entire idea of a placebo for diseases that are rapidly moving should make you feel really sad inside if you think about what what we're doing. If we could do digital placeos, then people don't need to be on a on a placebo arm and we can actually do that in a in a retrospective manner. So, we're working with the FDA to make changes to this. It will take time, but if we can do digital placeos, then we can actually get to faster resolution of diseases or or therapeutics. So, those are examples of the why. But, uh u why is it relevant to India? I mean, you got a massive scale problem. and u technology and digitization is the answer. >> Thank you Manish. Uh we move from AI to data. It's always the other way around. Uh coming now from culture to competence capability. We can talk all these things. We will have lot of technical maturity in the room in terms of tell me one problem I can give you 100 technical solution. But what is the organizational maturity? So it comes back to the capability we have in the room. Maybe Shiran the academy of digital health sciences. What is academy doing to build the capability for digital health? >> Thank you so much sir. It's a privilege to be a part of this esteemed panel at Academy of Digital Health Sciences. We believe AI and technology in healthcare technology is not a problem. The problem is the workforce readiness and that is where our inception since our inception we have believed that the main focus of digital health is the capacity building. And at Academy of Digital Health Sciences, we have trained more than 700 healthcare professionals including the senior institutions presidents, the hospital founders and CEOs, the clinicians with more than five decades of experience, their medical practices and we run courses which are dedicated to nurses, hospital owners, the founders of hospitals, doctors and the paramedics. the pharmacists because AI cannot be worked through one profession. We need to work in teams. A cumulative workforce is required. That is why we believe we all need to be trained in digital health. We are taking a next step and launching the global AI academy with global partnership between academy of digital health sciences and gener Gupta and the UC Davis CIO Dr. Dr. Ashish Atraja are the co-chairs of this academy where we want the trainings to be taken globally for all the healthcare providers and I look forward to taking this together so that the workforce is stronger enough so that we can deliver health care which is accountable and affordable to all. Thank you. >> Thank you Mish. And you know with such a distinguished panel uh we had reflections we had positive disruptions and we should have clarity of action. So I'm going to put five rapid fire questions to each one of them and then go to your questions because that is where we learn the most. First thing is I'm going to ask Anish and then say in the order one thing India must do in the next 12 months. Well, I'm a guest in the home, so it's not for me to suggest what you do, but what I would ask is as we think about the incentives to bring adoption, there may be an opportunity to bring the consumer voice first into that acceleration and maybe there's a shared commitment to do this between two countries to learn. Uh just a reminder uh the US has embarked on a healthc care uh empowerment journey to bring AI to the patient. Uh in July of last year, the Trump administration announced basically an extension of what President Obama referred to as the blue button initiative that the consumer should be able to pull their health records and use them however they wish. We are now landing the plane. You saw the news that Chad GBT health and claude for healthcare, the frontier AI models have now built a secure AI service that can bring your medical records in a separate area and allow you to ask questions to make a difference. Those models will be applied in India under your leadership uh with different companies and in different approaches. But figuring out how that relates back to the doctors and hospitals as we onboard them in the system, that's going to require shared learning incentives. And if we can do that together, I think we'll make a great deal of difference. So that's my as a guest in the home, a request and an opportunity. I think for next 12 months is going to be very challenging the kind of questions which has come to uh NHA and more so during this AI impact summit. I think the whole uh leveraging AI B on the data which we have under the PMJ and the ecosystem which we are creating under ABDM is going to be the biggest challenge and the immediate solution and probably is the opportunity is to actually take advantage of the technology which has already been tested in pilots to scale it to the population scale and this This is something which we have brought in form of a framework and a road map in the document which we have released yesterday that the strategy for AI in healthcare for India and this is where we will work for next 12 months to get it on the ground for large scale deployment of the AI in healthcare. The aim is as our honorable prime minister says AI in India means all inclusive. So uh our target is to reach out to 1.4 billion uh citizens make them part of this whole journey of AI. Thank you. >> Thank you Anand. >> You know I I'll build off of what was said already. Um I think this the spirit of collaboration that Anish said is really important. Um and I and I say that because we were one of the 60 companies who were actually invited to the White House to come and partake in this initiative where you're federating the data using proper uh authentication secure authentication techniques. You're federating data that's already fragmented to bring that data into the palm of the patient. Okay. that then those data points are used to guide the patient on their turnbyturn instructions that our algorithms deliver. So it's the gasoline that fuels the Ferrari so to speak and you're bringing that high octane gasoline to fuel the Ferrari which is great. So collaboration is going to be important but as Dr. Barnold just said, "I think we don't want to enter another phase of pilots." That would be really, really foolish because there's enough. Why is it that we send man to the moon once and everybody believes it, but for healthcare we have to do it a billion times to prove it? Come on. Let's let us move beyond this pilot phase and let's bring these things to scale. You know why? We will learn. We will learn from the first 30 days of engagement for a patient with the digital health tool. Their own data can then be used to predict are they on a path for success, are they on a path for failure, how should those data points alter the algorithms to then, you know, push them back on a path of success. We have to do that at scale. When we do it at scale, the learning we get from these experiments skyrockets. Yeah, you can learn one or two things from a pilot, but you're not going to scale. You have to have large volumes. You have to have large a base. And so I would encourage us to be bold. And you know what? I what's the saying? I'm 100% sure that we'll get 80% right. But that's better than nothing. And we have to be bold in our strategy. We have to be bold in our collaboration to harness this data and and empower patients and empower physicians. >> Thank you. And Manish. So, so I would just say um in many ways India is already doing it uh just by by hosting such a large scale event. Um that's a necessary and first step. But I want to highlight two things that happened um in the last 24 hours for for us and uh uh for India that will be really important to do this much more scalably and to do it much more rapidly. So in the last 24 hours, uh, Mayo Clinic platform and and IIT in this case, IIT Roper signed an agreement to allow IIT scientists access to this rich repository of Mayo Clinic's data to do uh development work because the need to have C clean curated data is an important part of innovation. Um and then we're going the second thing we did was to uh sign a partnership agreement with um LOI with ICMR to uh start to create some validation programs for any uh results that come out of that. And if those if if we can do that and do this 10 times over, 100 times over, a thousand times over, that's how we actually move forward faster because you know the concept of sovereign AI is important. But we all have to recognize that we still all live in the same ecosystem and if we can collaborate, we can all get to the end goal faster which is earlier intervention, better intervention, higher quality outcomes. >> Thanks Manish. Navish >> I would say to increase the budget of NHA so that we don't believe we don't with pilots but yes to deliver the projects. >> Thanks Mish we saw a very interesting thing on the policy on the standards collaboration being bold and you know uh scale data is important. I my next question is logical given the fact that we are moving at very fast speed. What is a risk that we are underestimating? one risk that we are underestimate underestimating Anish you then I'm going forward >> well this this is a little bit of a challenge uh will AI be deflationary to healthcare costs or will it be inflationary and the biggest risk that I fear if you look at the results in the US right now the earliest implementation of AI is seen as inflationary uh the health plans are complaining that the health systems are up coding and the health systems are complaining that the health plans are denying faster with AI. So we have a little bit of a back and forth that may not necessarily be in the best interest of the patient. So we need an economic model that ensures that the highest and best use of these capabilities and winning in the market is to help bring about an improvement in outcomes at lower cost. So that's my my biggest risk, the risk of inflation uh inflationary AI over deflationary. >> Thank you. Would you also say that there'll be a bigger divide with AI or less aer divide? That's another challenge. >> That's another challenge. >> Yeah. Okay. Soil, >> I think there is uh lot of risk which uh concerns a lot of people more so when we talk of AI in healthcare. Lot of people are concerned about the privacy. Lot of people are concerned about the trust of the models which they use and also there is lot of challenge about you know uh disclosures on which data is it trained how relevant it is in the geographies where it is being applied so these are several concerns but still I'll say I think uh we must prioritize innovation over the restaurant and therefore whatever be the concern the opportunity which AI brings can't be actually uh know uh reduced or cannot be undermined uh with the concerns which we have. Of course, we have to guard against that and that is why even the strategy document talks about it and even the open benchmarking platform which we have launched today is also about testing the AI uh models against the Indian data sets, real Indian data sets which makes it much more reliable and that is why I think uh concerns are being addressed but Still the risks are there which need to be mitigated. The inequity or bias which is being also talked need to be mitigated but we must harness the potential of AI to transform the healthcare delivery in India at a scale. >> Very well said Anand. >> Yeah. Um I see two risks Rajan and one is a real risk and one is a perceived risk. The real risk is patient safety. And if we have algorithms that are rogue, we have algorithms that are not trained on the right demographic. I'll give you an example. We have a an example where you can use a GPT- like algorithm. We call it a large sensor model, not a large language model because what it does is it takes a continuous glucose monitor sensor for people who knows CGM. You wear it on your arm or your belly and it tells you a glucose every 5 minutes. It'll tell you what the glucose is going to be one hour, two hour, three hours out every five minutes. That's pretty cool. And then you can tell the patient based on that, hey, do XYZ so you avoid going low, avoid going high, etc. You can coach them, right? That model works in certain demographics. If it's trained on certain demographics, if you apply that model in a flippant way to people that it doesn't apply for, then you're going to give them dangerous information that could harm the patient. So risk number one is patient safety. We have to do this in the in the with the guardrails of patient safety. The second risk is a perceived risk. We all hear about it all the time. It's prevalent throughout this whole conference. Is it is AI going to replace a doctor? Hell no. But I think a doctor who uses AI may very well replace a doctor who doesn't. So think about it. Just analogy. When you look up in the nighttime sky and you see a point of light and you're like, "Oh, it's a star or it's a planet for the more astute." But then you look in the web telescope and it's six galaxies. Okay. AI is to the doctor and the patient what the web telescope is to the astronomer. It lets them see things that they can't see with the naked eye. It lets them see beyond. Oh, that's what the problem is. Well, well, let's fix that. Let's work on that. And so the second problem of perceived risk, I don't think it's there. I think we have to conquer that. Let's go and let's be bold. Again to my earlier point, I don't think there's any perceived risk. We need doctors, but we need AI to help them. >> Thanks, Manish. >> So I think the primary risk is failure of imagination. Um we're going to take this really powerful tool u and apply it to existing processes. So give you an example, research is a hypothesisdriven industry. Somebody really smart comes up with a hypothesis and then validates that through clinical trials or um through uh validation studies. We're at a point where you could actually take large scale data and have it itself using AI produce hypotheses that then humans validate. That could be threatening to the entire research establishment today. And if you give this tool to them, you could have them use it in a way that's somewhat pedantic. So we have to be bold and rethink how we do everything from process from administrative processes, clinical processes, research processes uh in order to maximize it. Otherwise, we're going to add cost to Anisha's point against an overly burdened system already. A wish >> I would say AI is not just one word but a collaborative domain. So we should not look at AI single-handedly but in the entire ecosystem of digital health. >> Thank you. Now we're going to open the floor to questions. So please raise your hand and I'm sure there are mics that can be taken. >> Oh wow. I see this. Okay. I saw the first hand out there to that lady on the so I hope that we can get you the mics across quickly. This one question. Ask them quickly. >> Be short. Don't make comments. Just ask questions and tell whom you're addressing to. >> Yeah. >> Uh my question to Sunil Kumar, sir. Uh sir, how can traditional AIdriven uh predictive diagnostics be ethically and effectively integrated into healthcare data engineering systems to improve early detection of complex diseases such as uh cancer or any type of heart diseases. >> Yeah, this is the beauty of it. This AI in our case has to be embedded into the healthcare delivery and that is what the ABDM is enabling it. So we are not talking of any AI application as a standalone uh solution. So when we have created the data layer in form of ABDM AI will be the additional layer. So any any hospital any professional wants to use it actually it will be available. So the challenge is how to actually procure the AI solutions at the scale but technologically it is not a challenge. Of course training of the models on Indian data sets are the separate issues but once we have a AI solution it's deployment is not the uh problem and that is how it will work in the Indian context. Ka I'm Styi Toari. I'm a medical student from Auckland uh New Zealand. My question is uh how do we pre prevent overreiance on digital systems in clinical decision making and also how do we ensure that digitization uh reduces hospital emissions for example admissions for example rather than simply shifting um care online. Thank you. >> Anyone on the panel? Thank you. >> Maybe I'll just take a quick stab. We have a paper that just came out in the New England Journal of Medicine AI edition uh looking at a way to create more transparency in model benchmarks to understand the underlying values that you see embedded in a in a training model. Back to your question, if you asked it who should get the next kidney uh transplant, certain models will answer one answer and others will answer another and they have embedded in them biases as to where that allocation should be. So we need have a little bit of vision. There's no one dot model. There are going to be many models that are being trained and there's no transparency in understanding what the current uh uh biases or or or values are that are embedded in that model. And so we're calling for more transparency uh on model uh underlying models and that could be the basis of discussion about procurement otherwise. So we find those that are aligned to the values of our society. >> Very interesting situation. Let's speak. >> Very interesting situation though. Right now we had second opinion and referrals from doctors. We will have AI second opinion referrals eventually. >> Hello sir. Uh hello sir. I'm I'm Dr. Ashish. I'm a faculty department of psychary as bopal. My question is to Dr. Sunil. Digitalization of health record is uh definitely required but uh additional steps to ensure safety of mental health data. Is there is the government taking additional steps at a large scale? Second, uh whenever there is a collaboration between private sector as well as mental health professional still I see lot of research on PMED the ethical as well as legally safety guidelines are often overlooked. There are numerous paper. So is government taking or providing some uh checking or regulation body on those lines? Thank you. as co NHA I'm not the expert on uh you know any particular you know uh disease or the health problems but I can say that since you are in as Bopal and as Bopal does use the AVDM system for electronic health generation you will know that the patient record is still with the hospital and with the patient it is nowhere else in the system it doesn't migrate anywhere where from one one hospital to another hospital or from anywhere to anywhere unless the patient has consented. So that way the consent has been inbuilt by design itself and the data which has generate uh was generated is at the hospital. So hospital anyway knows it and basically is the uh issue of the medical profession. how do they keep that data with the uh doctors? So I believe the digital health system which is being put in place is nowhere conflicts with the you know uh privacy of that data and regarding many other uh you know uh efforts of the government for uh you know promoting uh mental well-being or reducing mental health issue. I think there is huge uh you know deliberation and you must have seen that there is a separate allocation in the budget for the mental health issues and challenges which the society and the country is going to face and therefore there are much more focused effort to address these challenges. The details of course you'll get to know uh with the experts who are working in this field. you yourself in a medical uh institution will get to know if there is any scheme which is actually promoting uh mental well-being. So that is how uh as of now NHA is concerned. >> We have two questions. We have two questions you know very well put by uh Suril is you know that this is the first case I've always seen technology moves faster than policy at least one thing I can say under the current leadership our policies move faster than technology that's for sure and I'm sure that we will set a template for the world I can't let this panel go without putting their last message 30 second message onish >> well I mean I think you just we want to jump on the bandwagon of what you want to uh scale up in the next 12 months. That's an inspiring message and I think we would like to see as much of that traverse uh globally so there can be a shared learning and feedback loop as we collectively scale. Uh my message is let every citizen be on the Abha ID first. Let everyone get the Abha ID. Those who are in the hall, how many of you have Aha ID? I think many of you don't have the AVA ID. Please get it uh immediately. This is the ID for your health throughout your uh health journey. >> The divine bell has rung. >> No, you would just say we would love to collaborate with you, sir. I'll say it for Anish too. Both of us would love to collaborate with you and we can figure this thing out together and be bold and and and we can change the way we manage health for chronic conditions going forward. >> Um if you have been in healthcare for more than a decade um this is the perfect time to be alive. you will leave a legacy uh on this planet that is much you that you know that will have improved healthcare outcomes for generations to come uh through all the work that we're going to accomplish together. So um hope you're energized and exercised about this as I am. >> Maybe share the last word. >> I would say healthcare will not become AIdriven because only technology is there. It is because people need to be trained in it. Thank you, Misha. Big round of applause for the esteemed panel. Thank you so much. Thank you.
