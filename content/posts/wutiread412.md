Interesting reads and references from the week.

Will keep this going every week and see how it grows.

## [#1 Product Market Fit with Nischay from JarApp](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pmf-convo-4-nishchay-jar-sajith-pai/)

This interview covers the importance of PMF and how to build features that comply with the PMF standard set without hampering growth.

Will cover my experience with the JarApp in the coming blogs - it's a WIP w/ some controversial takes on why it doesn't for me.

## [#2 Social Connection Makes a Better Brain](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-connection-makes-a-better-brain/280934/)

It's fascinating to learn why human brains are larger than other species and how it has something to do with the way human evolution has bet on social connections for evolution. Also covers the importance of social connections over material possessions.

## [#3 Guide to creating a Personal Brand](https://medium.com/digital-marketing-lab/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-personal-brand-in-2021-dfee8fb0666a)

Personal brands are all over the place and everyone has a brand of their own even if they feel like they don't - online and offline. This guide touches the surface trying to pick on the basics of creating a personal brand.

Now, after being part of building a brand and observing multiple brands experiment, will be interesting to see how I build my own.
