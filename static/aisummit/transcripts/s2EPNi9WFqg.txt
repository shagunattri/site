of unknown when new animal comes in you get scared after some push 20% start using it then 30% when they start getting the benefit then first person says it's a neighborhood effect if neighbor is using it I'll use it if neighbor is not using it I'll not use it so that's where we need to organize a thinking space that everybody thinks in the same manner that AI is going to make a difference over there when they create a momentum flywheel Fact we are finding within 3 months we created 9,000 agents in the company alone. In one company we created 9,000 agent but every manager in the company created their own agents. Now we are in a stage of consolidated those agents and we are launching team space for that and we'll show the demo of it that how we have mastered the entire SDLC life cycle how we mastered the sales and marketing tools and that's what we are trying to launch over here that if you want to reach to all the Indian companies there are so manymemes are there don't have any AI engineer how can they use it how many chartered accountants are there they need to audit so many so many balance sheets. How do they use AI to ensure that they are not missing the points? There are so many law law firms are there. They need to use AI. How do they use in a private environment? How do the small businesses can use AI for writing proposals and consistent proposal without losing the knowledge to general chat GPDs and co-pilots. So that's what we are trying to look at it. Once they start using it they it will expand their performance space. After 3 months you will say it may come to the outcome space which will happen. For disrupting that we say can we bring down the purple fabric. We had a lot of debate internally. Can we bring down the price point which can afford and I come out with a challenge to my technology team and research team that I want to launch this at 1 lakh rupees a month. less than half the cost of AI engineer even if you hire one engineer less than so I got inspired from Jio I said if Jio can disrupt the telecom market why can't we disrupt the AI market that everybody should use a tenant and they it's a private tenant for them and we'll just charge 1 lakh rupees a month 99,500 rupees per month for 50 users so if you and everybody in the company should use it not two three people should use it so that there's a freedom of choice on democratization then and this is the reason for engineing the platform with this accuracy ease of understanding ease of use so some of the cases I'll show you and I'll ask my team members of the research team members is here in this hall so all the research members will demonstrate your themselves what the power of it in outcome basis so this is my belief that everybody in the company should use it everybody as a citizen must use AI And I'm promoting this to mission Samriti to our villages. I had a session in rural India that all the clusters where mission sumi work we work in 82 clusters in eight states where we are contributing to 2 million population and around 1,800 villages. So when I took a AI session for them one month back I took a master class for AI session for rural India and teach them how they can design a How can they design that? If they want to manufacture chocolate in village, why should Cadbury should sell in my rural India? Why should soap should sell in India? Why can't they manufacture their own own soap? So if village can be self-sufficient then only the rural India will grow and that is only possible when the export import equation of the village can be. So we we have a slogan in it goes back to the urban cities not vice versa. So how to bring reverse the trend then village become exporter of the things because they are the only producer of the food and everything but they are the importing so many other things which is having a trade trade deficient for the villages. So to transfer that to me AI is a great equalizer for them to come to help them improve their cognitive capabilities and performance based both. So there that's a point I we are saying that village can come at the same level today and we when we taught them within no time the three four entrepreneurs came in one started making chocolate somebody start making soap because they are taking they're using chipity or gemini which is coming free of cost to them and a free version they're able to make the recipes and they are able to make the how it how to create a brand how to create a packaging all are being done by the villagers so AI is something which is so uh interesting over here we have enterprise AI design center in the exhibition it takes 30 minutes to visit there and understand how design is done of the AI transformation so please visit that in the meantime I'll invite uh for showing you natural language banking which is beyond bankings which is connecting banking and social impact and government schemes together in a single system where you will not be knowing that behind the scene there are more than 25 agents are working together to give you the output on the tip of the iceberg that's a thing thank you thanks Har uh guys again it's me back again I'll first want to check uh anyone who's not conversant with uh any of the Indian languages Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Bengali, Gujarati, any one of them just let me know. Then I'll try and have a parallel session in English only English. You'll have to bear with me because I have to be inclusive here for everyone. So before we start talking about as to what is uh bring up the screen guys just bear with me. Start talking about what are the screens. Banking used to be in a very very different way of format. some three four decades back. Some of you who were not born at that time may not realize it. Bank was accessible to all. You never had to be a literate so as to say be conversant in a particular language. All you needed was to know the banker Mr. Sharma or Gupta Gi whosoever was there walk to the teller tell him please balance password sorry I'm switching the language context but I'm trying to make it uh comprehensible for everyone here so I want to deposit money into an account I want a demand draft to be issued I want to open a fixed deposit there was a human on the other side who not only knew how to converse in my language but also was empathetic to the cause I had. He will not tell you okay fixed deposit do it for 3 months. He will tell you for how long do you want the deposit to be there? Till when you don't want this money one year I'm giving you the best rate for that. So the empathy factor the human factor existed. This banking was accessible inclusive but it was terribly slow. People used to take a day off from work their own business or kids used to I have personally stood in a line where my father has given me a check and a deposit slip filled go stand in the queue go and tell the teller an go ahead and deposit a check he'll stamp the re strip and come and deposit it back to my father. So that's how banking used to be. Then in '90s the kids of like us who were growing up suddenly we got excited by internet and mobile banking. Mobile banking came way later somewhere after smartphones became a thing. Before that if all of you are aware USSD used to be common you send an SMS you get your balance you're able to do it and now UPI is the norm. But with that, how many of us can relate to the aspect that technology became suddenly inaccessible? There's a China wall between those who are techsavvy and those who are technically challenged. At least I agree to that. I I'm personally the technical support desk for my uncles, my aunties, my grandparents, even my wife. And you'll be surprised even for my son who struggles to open a mobile app and tries to send X amount of money to person A which is not a beneficiary registered in the same bank. He doesn't know what any FT is. He doesn't know when to use NFTT. He doesn't know when to use RTJS. What is IM? They all are accessible. UPI is accessible. They all conversant with it. But UPI has a limit. You cannot do more than one lakh. So in case a poor guy who's studying in a college right now and stays in a host has spent some 1,500 rupees and suddenly I ask him oh you have to transfer one lakh rupees like I can only do 99,000 and whatever balance of 850 rupees so it's restricting the technology is available amazingly fast but it is only available to those who can cross or consume the barriers of manuals and menus those who can navigate who can understand and those who are able to adapt to the change. What changed? Every other day in the name of modernization of the technology frameworks, the UI screens change, the navigation change, the button changes, the colors changes, the font changes. Believe me, for those technically challenged, it was always a difficult job to learn how to access that app. But the moment you're going on uh can I bring up the screen please? But the moment you go ahead and start upgrading those apps, suddenly everything breaks. They need to be retrained. So as Arin was pointing out, we talk about AI. How do we democratize this? We talked about AI being democratized for the enterprise and one of my colleagues will be walking you through that particular thing. But how do I democratize AI banking so that it is accessible for all? How do we make banking invisible and inclusive for every generation, every individual everywhere across their technical ability? So we'll be just demoing you quickly on that particular part and in the course of that I'll be switching multiple languages. If a particular language I'm not following the right accent, please bear with me. I'm just trying to demonstrate what is. So here is a scenario where anme is trying to interact with the bank. Please understand we are not here to tell you relog and uh work on this particular part and let's attempt that. Namaste banking advis it's not that he is partial to Gujarati or something that is one of the favorite language given some glitch guys I'll be Honance notific. Berlin instructions. So guys, the use case here was you will have lots of small enterprises or MSMES who are now shipping out products globally and when they do that they have their associated inward remittances in foreign currency. Who are those guys that they are not conversant with the FEMA compliance as to what they have to do? That is where an expert agent is working behind the scene and telling you what exactly has to be done. Hey instructions any fata very sardaji trying and attempting his hand at Tamil that's that's the part I have attempted let me see if it is able to do that but guys more important given the time at hand we are there in hall 2 booth number seven do visit us we have the detailed demo As Arun said we have something which is describing the social initiatives as well as to how anyone who does not have the information handily available can interact using this particular models and access it. I'll just pass on the baton to my friend who will be there presenting you about the team spaces concept. Over to you, please. Good afternoon everyone. Uh thanks for this. I think we had a very exciting session by Gonit. So now Sanvi goes back come back to the team spaces. So here we are launch here we're launching here we launching the team spaces. So what we're talking about is like uh we have been using lot of these tools earlier where we have got sharepoint portal we have got lot of these document management systems where people go and access data and from there on we move to the chat bots where like you know uh the the data is available the knowledge is available but it's all about automation from there on we move to something called as theme spaces this theme space actually is like you know moving from the age-old tools that we had which are very pointed to like know individual iduals versus going towards the teams bringing all the teams together along with the digital experts which are run by some agentic solutions there. So basically what we are saying is earlier we are seeing individually what's the productivity that we are getting. Now we are trying to look at the business outcomes as a team. No one is really interested like you know to have a single person giving a productivity where it can move from 1 to 1.5x. But whereas when you move it a team actually the business outcome is what is achieved. That's what here we are talking about. So basically exactly what it talks about from where we move from the uh so-called scripted document storage to the so-called team spaces we have our purple fabric which is the agentic solution. So typically when we actually look at anywhere in the world the content creators or the agent that are being built are only 5%. And we see 95% of them actually consume it. So while everybody is so much concerned about building agents and like you know getting their dirty hands actually they're not so so many people we look at the 95% consumers and we need to really take them take them into our like fold to see how we can actually cater to them. So we move our needle to say like know while we have the purple fabric which is our platform on which we can actually build the digital experts we actually look at how these digital experts can be provisioned to the consumers. So that's where the team space uh uh comes into picture. So what we have done it's actually like know a team space here is not for individual even if individual from the team walks away still the knowledge is retained and it is shared by the team as the team actually keeps using those digital experts the knowledge keeps like an enhancing and it's retained within the system and the context is actually prevailed and most importantly team space is primarily for a function delivering a business outcome. So what we actually able to do is like you know we are able to move from the individual productivity to the a business outcome as a team. With that I just move on to a quick demo of the team space what we have. Sorry. Can you get the screen please? Not to get my screen. All right. This is how the team space looks. So what we actually have devised is uh a team space for enterprises. Enterprises could be any enterprise. It could be an IT service company or it could be engineering mission shop or any such. And we also have a team space for bank. A bank team space what we call a public team public sector team space as well as HR team space and insurance. Just quick having a quick look for anme when we really look at it right so he's a single man army where he has to handle between a sales marketing and in fact like know finance and HR probably he may have a small team which can actually do engineering so what we have done is like you know we augment each of these teams with the digital expert for example in sales and marketing when he really wants to go and do his work he's augmented with extra digital experts so which he can able to get his work done so we can actually have uh some over here We are talking about some sort of a bank case studies you may want to do it or some sales analytics you want to drive it or or some lead generation you can do it over here in in HR for example there could be a few more digital experts so what I'm talking about here is like know bringing each of the functions into a space and augmenting them with these digital experts so that the knowledge is retained within this within each of those functional blocks and you're able to like you know leverage and not depend on single person rather Move on to the teams quickly. Moving on to how a particular bank team space looks. In a bank typically is always operate between a business operations and technology. So you may have your team space constrained about this branch operations, credit operations in for example in a credit operations you may have your loan collections, loan origination. Then in case of HR, finance sorry in trade operations for example you can talk about your LC digitization, bank guarantee etc etc. So basically what we talk what we are trying to say here is like we move on to uh like you know bank theme spaces with each of these operations as functional block. How typically a bank gets like you know visualized in any We are running out of time. So, uh let's look at this one more important team space which is the HR team space. In the HR team space, you can really find acquisition, development, operations, remination, engagement. And while you do all this, you can actually go ahead and also create your own team space. For example, over here you can actually go and say like you know create your own team space. Sometimes there could be a shared services where you may be working on some engineering, you may be working on say like you know support etc. So you can actually have a team space created for your own team which is called FEX for example and you can actually pull up those uh like you know distance expert which you use for that particular team. You can also include in fact a third party co-pilots or any such sort of like you know uh agents into this and create a common team space and the team together can actually have these digital experts augment them to to increase the productivity pace so much so about the team space probably I think for positive time I'll try to move on to the next speaker you want to Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. As you see here, as you see here, for example, I have the proposal uh uh proposal letter. has to come. Yeah. Yeah. Let me let me just come up. All right. You say different presentation slide. It's not coming to the working slide. So concept of the team space is that the any small theme or small corporate midc corporate has got these many functions. Each function like sales and marketing will have a multiple function. Lead generation is one function. Proposal writing is a second function. Followup of the lead is a third function. Customer conversation is a fourth. So now if these are the various work which happens in sales similarly human resources recruitment is the one function performance management is second function that is a kind of a area now for each of them you need a agent now we are giving to the cme sector in one lakh rupees all of it ready made now it's >> we are competing against co-pilots and everybody else co-work which is anthropic has launched two weeks back we are they they are working on individual productivity we are working on team productivity because outcome is a team as a outcome not a individual as a outcome and it stores all the data of the company in a one place so proposal data is there you can store it in one place and past proposal can go previous all the knowledge can go on the proposals and you can generate a new proposal within a few seconds a few minutes when the new proposal is coming in and you can modify by improving the knowledge. So this is where we are seeing democratization of AI in a public space by bringing the right price point instead of using a disparate systems you can use a one system together. Yeah, it's going yeah these are the so these are these are different uh like you know uh uh digital experts what we have. So we have the lead generation, we have the proposal generator and also have the sales analytics that are there. So quickly I just positive time what I have done is I have taken one of the proposal and I have uploaded it and then I have a few questions that I have asked about the proposal and it summarizes that and then I pick up those line items that are there in the proposal and try to create the response. So this is how a typical RFP if I have actually uploaded a particular RFP and I keep asking about summarize the key primary objectives mentioned by the bank in a particular proposal. Here we took up to pick up a proposal and it actually talks about what that particular proposal is all about and what the bank has mentioned any evaluation criteria that are there and it actually lists down what is that it's going to be a strategic fit what is the functional fit of that then how as a vendor how do we fit all those details it actually tries to give it also talks about for this particular proposal what are the countries that are in scope is it only about India or any other like you know countries that are in place and also we can also talk about like you know has any format been mentioned in which it has reached and any file size limits that have been mentioned for us to respond for this particular proposal. Then what are the critical commercial and pricing pointers? So all these questions we ask so that we actually get the complete information about this proposal in in a fraction of minutes we get this and we can actually have a direction setting call to see like okay let's go with this or not. Once we decide on that we actually can go to the line items here the same d expert where we have got first comp comprehensively understand what the particular proposal is all about and then go to the line items upload the line items that are there. So the question is that the proposal contains we upload them and we actually go ahead and actually for example if it contains a particular specific things about a product that we need to understand we use a product expert and tries to get the details about it. If it is not generic >> yeah this is okay. So this is where the simple example now I invite Deepak to just show how the agents are designed. So what agents are there? We need to show how they are designed. So the agent designer is there. Deepak Dasala is our chief technology officer at Intellect who is brain behind putting the purple fabric technology. uh more than 100 engineer research engineer work for him and he'll show you how he simplified that you anybody can make the agents out of AI and uh Vishua and Deepak will show you how the agents are built. Now you have seen three things. First is my natural language conversation which is working in a banking which is beyond a one product across the business lines. Second is in a enterprise space how it can work in each of the industry segment it can work and third how do you make a agent simplify it deeper call for you thanks Aron so what we are going to do in next 10 minutes uh we will show the whole life cycle agent life cycle uh how that can be created from scratch so this is a purple fabric platform and what we are showing is uh completely the agent studio where all the agents that are built these agents are conversation agents, automation agents and it pretty much covers uh everything that you expect uh the kind of an I would say the complexity that that you can anticipate in an enterprise. So in the 10 10 15 minutes what's possible I'll show if you guys have any questions happy to really answer that uh after this particular call. So yeah just go ahead. Yeah no no go ahead with the agents when you create the agents. just click on it. So this is just when someone is starting they can start with a single agent, multi- aent or the multi- aent uh automation flow and all. So these are the three choices are there and when we when they're creating the agent itself we actually capture the details whether they're looking for the conversation agent or the automation agent and also whether it's a private or public mean you want to do it for yourself or you want to do it across your organization or a team and all. So go ahead for the existing one. So what we can do is this is the a kind of an uh agent design screen and in this case uh yeah we have a like as Arum said the freedom of choice in this case pretty much we can configure any model whether it's an internal or external as long as it's available as an API. In our scenario if you see right we pretty much configure the model from the all the cloud providers. One of the important thing is because it's an enterprise grade we we we are we really take care of security uh and we give a lot of importance to security. We go through only the cloud provider because they work as an escrow but in the case of an enterprise uh if they have the internal models they can configure. I'll show you where to configure and how to configure and this is where the whole I mean the p perspective design will happen which probably a lot of people you see it as a prompt engineering but in this the example that I'm going to walk through with you is about a corporate due diligence scenario and all so we have built think about this as a a role who is a due diligence analyst and what that particular person he or she will do we captured here in the prompt anyway we'll not focus on prompt engineering sharing with you we'll focus on how this particular uh platform will help you to uh design something at a scale. So let's go ahead right I mean in typical charge a JP kind of scenario you built a great prompt and now you're asking a due diligence related question uh for probably uh for a company like a Tata Motors and all so this is basically a kind of an agent which is actually answering this particular question based on the probably you can say the little bit of the knowledge that it's trained on. So most of the things this is what the people do out there and then the question is uh how do you rely on kind of a thing. So the good thing with this uh current scenario is uh we need not go anywhere else. We can ask the actually model itself. This is something that you can rely on. So this is where I know at least the models are becoming a little bit more truthful and it is saying that my analysis is on the general knowledge and a training data and probably if you have to do it in the right way you itself give you the correct approach that you need to do that and this is where how to do that at a scale is the purple fabric will come into the picture. So like as Arun said the most important thing is how do you get your knowledge right? How do you get your reasoning right and how do you get your context right. So let's start with the knowledge. If you see this is where we have a a knowledge studio. Um if you can go to the probably the knowledge studio and for this in the interest of a time just hold down here. So no just go back please knowledge studio. Yeah just stay here. So in in enterprise right you might be dealing with the marketing knowledge you might be dealing with the risk related knowledge and all most important part is how what you build how do you reuse it and how do you get it right in enterprise you always you'll have a data owner now probably the knowledge owner as a role will emerge who will be the custodian and garden of getting that knowledge right and continuously curating it and keeping it relevant. So in this scenario just think about like a there is a a company documentation is a knowledge garden that is already created which has uh probably the all the relevant documents and sources that are being uh captured over the period of a time continually kept it relevant and this is the this is a thing and typically right we are just taking an example of 110 over here but in reality this will run into the thousands or uh lakhs or millions kind of a thing. So what is the focus for us is how do you prove that your knowledge is right this is where what we have done is if you can and also secure so if you want to probably uh first let's uh yeah so when the knowledge is actually created what we do is I know lot of people are aware of a rack database and all but we do a lot more pre-processing to ensure that actually we got it right we always believe that the data that we are receiving is wrong and prove it otherwise ways so we have a pre-process processing pipeline which will clean and then refine classify everything and finally we put it into the chunks. So when you're putting into chunks also right like how a typical data architect or data analyst validate the the quality of a data right here you have a valid opportunity to really validate these chunks at a at a at a right level whether they are they are a right quality or not for example uh and yeah and also what we believe is there is no single approach to deal with that because typically when you're dealing with document right everyone in a financial industry understand how important is to get your table data right how important to get your image data Right? But also we know that not necessarily that you want to apply that everywhere. So we have an opportunity to really configure whether you want to do the table extraction, image extraction and all those things. And also the what should be your chunk strategy. If you can click on that chunk no chunk strategy please. >> Yeah click on the chunk strategy. Yeah page level. Yeah. >> Okay. So it's published but otherwise you'll have an opportunity to do the chunking at a page level, block level, word level. So that what is the right for you. So it's everything is configurable and all. Now let's let's also take in when we say chunk right when you click on this how exactly it will look like. For example in this scenario this is a completely typical uh graph that you expect out of an annual report of any company. What we do is not just extract it be kind of a summarize this in a in a certain way. So tomorrow when you are looking for the very context this is available. So if you look into this it is kind of probably you can pick one of them you can it actually interprets uh what is that light blue what is that navy blue actually correlate to and it gives you the complete details over here so that there is a right interpretation for each graph is there and all if you see there is no direct correlation at all it was just given somewhere else so it understood that light blue is dark navy blue is iit and light blue is iita and all so this is the level of the quality. Similarly the if you go for the table right and again always border table borderless table where the rows columns and everything are merged we just don't take this particular data table alone we actually really get this uh structure right in terms of a column header row header merged unmerged and we get the structure right because in the context to get the context table it's very important to uh really do this. So we just don't take the data and dump the data. We really create a right structure so that can be leveraged because again going back to the same formula right get your knowledge right context right accuracy right and all these small things matter matter. Moving on and what also we do is we ensure that the data is really secured and all. So if you look into this um we we also interpret whether you're dealing with any PIA data. If you can u click on this please sorry Vishua has a wet uh fingers. So by while while we are storing itself we understand and we again depending upon strategy you want to mask it or probably if you if you just go to the other example uh you completely uh kind of anonymize it in such a way so that you don't lose the context because it's very important to understand whether that particular value is a date time or it's a name or anything because sometimes people will just u uh mask it that will lose the context of whether it the what is that entity stands for and everything. So we we we anonymize it, we mask it depending upon the strategy that people look for. Now going back to the agent that we are building um this is the one that is built in a way. So if you see just add a knowledge over here. So the due dilence one and as I said it's all about a reusability for us. So what you build uh as a knowledge garden that is available for a selection and you might not just link with one knowledge you might end up linking one knowledge in this case the company due diligence is the uh the knowledge that we want to add uh you want to add that sorry just add it that's fine yeah okay so just in this case we are just this is just brings in the whole knowledge that is that need to be referred and similarly right as you saw that model itself said you you should have ability to really scrap the web out there bring the newses out there on the Tata motors and all and then this is a multi- aent like in a typical world you'll never have a one role actually do the whole job you'll have a multi- aents which are specialized in the different areas so we have the company website agents sanctions checker reporter analyst all these agents who can be just added like how he added the knowledge garden and further if you really want uh the further fine-tune to be done to the model we have a ability to really fine-tune the experience also. Now this is just if you see what happened is we just had a kind of a a master agent with the sub agents linking to the external tools link uh and these sub agents also will be talking to the some of the internal also and then we have the complete agent in place. Now let's again in the interest of time we when we ran this like this is the the kind of a report that will come in picture which is far more comprehensive and the most important part is this is all we haven't before even publishing you can verify it and you can run it and then you can see how these agents have worked together and what they have done and how they have arrived it click on the traces so you'll get to know exactly at each and every step if you see here to start with while we will show you. It is first doing the toxity prompt validation. So input itself click on the before one please. Yeah. So just create the due diligence report on data motors. It is checking that whether there is any toxity in the input request that was given only if it has once it's qualified. Why this is so important is people are forgetting that tomorrow your agents is your brand. So your brand, your culture, all have has to be represented so that you're speaking the right language and you're not allowing anything that's probably you don't want to be known for. So we just check all these guardrails up front during the input as well as an output. And this how these whole agents are working together to arrive at the outcome and what source it has done. If if you see it has got all the details go down please. And it has all the source and you can look at a lineage from which document what it has got and all those things. Click on the query planner. So if you see this is where the advanced rack capability and everything will come into the picture. So how we have taken a question what is the output it is there at every stage you know what is your cost what is your performance how much token that it has taken. So this also will help you to optimize. I'm I'm just rushing in the interest of time but this give you the clarity of the whole agent design. Okay. Now moving on if you go to the sorry go back to the benchmark please just so yeah just stay here. So what you have seen is you have seen this agent working right now. How do you know which model is right? How do you know which is the right cost? We have the whole benchmarking capability. It can look into the it can actually put one model against another and see the how it works on the cost latency the tokens and also the contextual accuracy. If you click on this metrics by default we give the evals on this exact accuracy, context accuracy, faithfulness, groundness, relevance and operational attributes like cost, latency, tokens. Then you also can create your custom events because typically domain experts will have their own events to be created and this will help you to really create your custom events and apply on this particular agent so that you can benchmark the agents at a right level before you put it out to the production. Now what I'm showing here is um and again this just gives you the complete uh uh evals how they works. Now this is just showed you the conversation agent. Yeah, >> I'm just showing over here the cost of this query is 0.59. It took 31.8 seconds. It has used 13,000 tokens. So each model has the cost which is associated with it. So I think we need to just run short of time. So uh this is a preview of what advanced technology we are bringing on the table which is equivalent to Palenteir. Palent is a company which is in US valued $300 billion but the technology complexity is not for all of you to understand how the agent works and operates. So this is a purple fabric advance and for theme what we shown team spaces is purple fabric standard. So there are two categories in which we are launching this product in this uh India impact AI summit. So that's the beauty of it is that the it is proven the fact the biggest architects of HSBC bank or HDFC bank or other banks when we are demonstrating we are challenging them their own capabilities what they're doing and what intellect can bring on the table and that's a phase I did a master classes in almost uh all the cities in India and London Okay. Toronto, Singapore, Middle East. So all the places I had done the master class. So there's a humongous amount of interest in getting this technology up. But there's a cycle time for getting the right acceptance of a technology because there's a lot of greyness in the market by everyday new models are coming in. So so idea is that AI is for everyone. AI must be used by everyone and there are many use cases you can see in the stall and we would like to invite into hall 2 7A is our stall where you can come spend some time how this whole AI is to be designed so thank you very much for this session to attend it. So I think I think we are getting a call from everybody. Thank you very much. Is he whatever? feedback. Hello 12th September 2024. or FC Bank. Namaste. Requesting all who have joined here to please take your seat and settle. Now we will be opening the sessions in another 2 minutes. Good afternoon everyone. I am Albert Dylan on behalf of UIDA extending a very warm welcome to this special session organized by the unique identification authority of India at the Bhat AI impact summit 2026. Today we gather to reflect on something fundamental yet often invisible. Identity. The foundational layer that underpins every trusted interaction, every meaningful engagement, and every secure exchange in our world. As our world becomes increasingly digital and AI adoption accelerates at an unprecedented pace, we must pause and ask ourselves, what defines a truly trustworthy identity? How do we build and sustain trust in an AIdriven ecosystem? With artificial intelligence reshaping the landscape of digital identity, what lies ahead for Aadhaar? How will it evolve? How will it adopt? And most importantly, how will it continue to serve as a trusted enabler in a future powered by AI? The possibilities are immense. Seamless service delivery, smarter authentication, enhanced inclusion, and datadriven governance. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Today's session, the identity paradox will explore this dynamic intersection where trust meets technology and identity meets intelligence. We will examine how AI can power the next phase of Aadhaar ensuring that trust remains uncompromised. The presentation will be led from the leaders from UIDA, Sri Bara Prasad Sabut, head of engineering, Sri Sridar Dulipala, principal advisor design and Zach Nan, head of innovation. I request the speakers to please take over this session and open up the session. Right. Uh good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Uh thank you for uh being here and uh giving your time to uh dwell on some of the uh issues. uh we we have said it is identity paradox because the issue what we are going to discuss the impact of AI what we are going to explore it is bit paradoxical uh and what challenges it imposes on an identity platform like UIDI we were going to dwell on that and the the this is a conversation which which we intend to do with the industry to seek your participation in solving some of these real challenges that we do see with the advent of AI. Uh for centuries uh identity is always anchored with the physical presence. When you see somebody, you always believe that he's real. When you see a signature on the check, the whole financial institution works around that fact that if they see a signature on a check, they believe that it is real. And on the identity card, if you see a photograph, you trust that this person is genuine carrying the identity card. Now, with the advent of internet, what happened? This identity verification shifted from physical domain to to a remote kind of verification. the verifiability context came into the play like if I can verify a biometric which is being offered through a whether in front of an assisted in in in an assisted mode or in a remote process I trust that person so that's the verifiability aspect came with the advent of internet now along with the verifiability also came deception Certain amount of deception was always there in the physical when the physical presence was getting uh was getting trusted that time also deception was there with with the remote verification also deception was there but what happened with the ID uh with the AI the deception technique became industrialized the way the fake voice fake fake biometrics, fake facial image that is getting generated. I wouldn't be wrong if I say that the deception technology has matured well and well ahead of it the time and that's why today we are trying trying to understand how do we stop those deception technique and ensure that the broken story of seeing is believing is not going to be a reality. How do we protect the identity platform? So before I move on to some of the opportunities I would like to take some take a pause and set the context. So if you look at the hard problems of identity. What are the hard problems? The first is inclusivity and why it is more so important because this is a foundational layer in any DPI structure and inclusivity is very very important. So how how it is how it is going to impact when we are speaking in reference to AI how inclusivity matters the models that we use today in UI at UIDI we have bunch of models which are helping us to protect the our platform identity platform they're all inclusive in nature we are rich as a country we are rich with diverse set of demographics We have uh people from uh from various uh I would say various geographies that helps us in training our model and making sure that our model is unbiased and it is helping to ensure inclusivity. But going forward can this inclusivity be extended to the certain set of people who are still not accessing this technology. For example, today we imple we have face authentication in our portfolio. Is the face authentication is completely inclusive? The answer is no. Some subset of special people still they are not in a position to access the face authentication. Can we do something with the use of with the help of technology and bring them on to this portfolio? That is something we would like to have a conversation with the industry. Privacy uh privacy uh if you look from AI point of view, privacy may not be a directly concerning AI may not have a direct impact on the privacy. But why we are speaking of privacy over here is uh like we used to whenever we used to go to any uh networking conference we always get to hear this that UI is rich with data. Yes. We do have the largest catalog of biometrics data. We do have 170 140 cr of Aadhars with us. We have the demographics. We have the documents. But is this data accessible to us to train the model? The answer is no. We are still a responsible organization. We believe on data minimization, usage of the data of a Aadhaar holder. We do have guardrails to to use this data for any kind of model building. Now why I'm talking this with the community over here is we need to talk we need to understand we need to think about the technologies that is required to leverage this data in a confident in a privacy preserving way. Some of these technologies are already being discussed in many forums but what we need to do is put these technologies into the reality. Right? So that's the that's the privacy part. The trust is like the any identity platform why our AUS and KAS or or our partners they trust our plat the identity uh response that we give because they believe that we have done adequate verification and deliberation when we give out a response to to a request. So that trust needs to be preserved rather it has to be reinforced in the AI domain. Now moving on to the some of the engineering challenges scale and latency we know that when we operate a population scale solution these are some of the things we cannot ignore and our solution has to meet the scale challenges as well as at the same time it has to be low latency. So these are the some of the fundamental concepts that we need to uh we we need to set at the outset when we have the conversation for the opportunities that AI provides. We believe that though AI has an adversial impact on on the identity platform, it also brings in lot of opportunity to defend that platform. So uh in 2019 we started this journey with this belief that we can leverage AI to protect this identity platform. We came up with initially we started with a finger livveness project. Today if you see this project has fractified has matured and at scale we perform livveness of each and every fingerprint that enters our platform for verification. That's a that's that's a very the highly recognized success story and inferencing at population scale has al also been recognized in the industry. Now this is our success story around finger. But what about the new threats that is emerging because of the AI? Are we really prepared? Yes to some extent to ensure to to ensure the trust around the identity platform but we need to do a bit more on this. We need to so that is the collaborative work that we are uh seeking with the industry so that we develop next generation models to identify the frauds around the authentication around the identity and prevent while it is occurring. That is something we are seeking partnership and my colleague Zach will be covering that in detail. Now moving on from livveness similarly on the biometric side the classical bio biometric dduplication technology perhaps it has come to its end of life. Today the classical algorithms are being replaced with AI based approach. Machine learning models are what we have observed that machine learning models are better at performing accurate matching of the biometrics. Now how do we ensure those models are free from bias free from uh any kind of uh say it it it it it has to be secured as well as it has to ensure that there is a trust around the matching process. So these are some of the work that as an as a collaborative effort we need to undertake with the industry. Same as OCR uh I'm sure today if you have seen this hall there are lot of stalls around the document processing we also as an identity provider when somebody gets enrolled into our ecosystem or into our platform we do verification based on the document that it it provides. So verifying those documents at scale and also the kind of the diverse set of document that we get some of them in English and most of them in local language how do we interpret that and ensure that the person who is getting onboarded to the platform or doing an update to its claim they are all it is a trusted process. So that is these are the again collaborative effort that we are seeking at this place. Next is the voice assistance. So on the voice front uh we believe that this is going to be a key enabler for us in the in improvising our our connect with the residents. So we will demonstrate some of the work that has been done. We we are one of the early adopters of sovereign models that is being developed within this country on voice front and we have implemented them in order to in order to detect any kind of fraud and reach out to the resident at that point of time and intimate about or taking a confirmation around the event. So this is something we will be demonstrating but this is just a story that is we just started perhaps we need to take scale it out with richer set of models or the technology that is likely to come. Now I mentioned what has worked for us so far and what is to be done. Definitely we have been seen a good amount of success on livveness when whether it is finger livveness or it is fa face livveness also the uh detecting fraud at scale related to biometric capture whether it is capture of the fingerprint or face or iris we have been successful in detecting them with the help of AI but again this is something a game wherein we need to be ahead of the race otherwise we until somebody will try and bring down an identity platform. Uh I was mentioning about the voice on the voice side as I said this is a new channel that that we are leveraging for to to connect with our residents. If you look at today the sovereign models that we have in our country, they are good at communicating with the residents at in their local language following the dialects and the and the uh uh and the language. Right? So we have leveraged some of them. We'll just showcase one demonstration. In this demonstration what we are doing we whenever there is an authentication request comes to our platform we detect whether uh whether this is a fraudulent attempt or or the resident is is impacted because these biometrics are not matching. There are multiple attempts we are seeing and at that point of time we are reaching out to the resident to take a confirmation. This is an out of band confirmation that we are trying to take from the resident. Excuse me. Audio please. HDFC Banking authent. HDFC Bank HDFC Bank. Thank you. Right. So this is where we are using a sovereign model of one of our startups and we have integrationship. Number 2024 center digits 13 42 HDFC center name HDF FC Bankal, Whitefieldcess 300 appointment enrollment center. Thank you. >> The uh second demonstration is uh is this is getting triggered when whenever you visit any enrollment center of UIDI for any update or enrollment process based on a sampling. We are triggering this voice feedback call and our objective is to identify the experience that resident has has uh the experience of the resident and that is again it it happens within 5 minutes of the transaction and imagine this power of this technology today it is very much doable to reach out to every person who is visiting the UIDI enrollment center and take a feedback and that helps us in preserving that trust around the platform. It will also ensure us to verify whether there is any ground level fraud happening in terms of overcharging for a free transaction that is being offered by UID or that is a fixed price transaction being offered by UID. As I said voice as a capability we have just started. This technology is improv improving day by day. Today in today in on 18th of this month we saw three of our AI startups in this country up with the models. This technology is fast evolving and our objective over here is to leverage some of them and build capability which will help us to improvise our engagement with the citizens. So with this I will now hand over to Sridar G wherein he will come and explain or discuss some of the ideas wherein AI can be leveraged for a better engaging experience of the citizen with our platform. Yeah. >> Uh thank you. Thank you Savaji. So uh the theme recurring theme uh at the summit so far you have been hearing is all about how uh there's so much energy that is consumed to build these frontier models. Uh there is a data point floating that uh there is enough energy consumed by uh all the uh leading frontier models that it can power the entire African continent's electricity needs for a year. So we are hearing these things. The important point that we want to focus on and what we care about at UIDI is what the conference team says welfare for all happiness for all. So as a designer and at and user experience something we care for here. Uh one of the uh most fundamental barriers for inclusion is language. So uh what we realize is that uh we also know from a lot of the training of uh languages that the intelligence the inference layer uh at the pre-training is 99% in English not just English but probably American English and uh so there's a lot of under representation and that's why there's a strong case even for our sovereign models and things like so language is something we are focusing not just because of AI but we realize that that's an important I think even for our 133 cr users who come in every day and don't understand some of the technical nature of some of the documents or verification or even messages like what is authorization and certain terms. So uh we spoke with lot of users and we found there are all kind of challenges people have which are cognitive and so that is uh some of things we try to address. So that is the first issue which uh we feel uh if we address uh strongly in through all the interfaces at various touch points uh of uh UIDI across the country that would be uh make that uh everything uh more accessible. The second issue I want to get to is in terms of how we are approaching it is uh something we're looking at is what happens in from a cognitive load point of view. There are multilingual solutions but it's like uh when you go to a site I mean we have seen the data that 99% of the users are still sticking to the English though we have uh all the major languages represented and why are people not using it. So if you look at it there is the fMRI studies and cognitive neuroscience has shown that actually there are multiple pathways uh to in the uh in the cognition that how we process information as a human and uh the the uh audio the sound takes a different pathway and uh uh site visual cortex dominates most of our processing and our energy as we scroll things. So the uh how do you there is a cognitive loads cost and there's a switch which is why there is another uh reason why people are not able to use multilingual and multimodel so conveniently and so that is something we are trying to keep in mind as we improve and so uh using these thoughts uh some of the uh some of the early experiments like uh Sabuji was saying we are trying out is uh something like a document when you want to do an address update. There are some 30 plus documents that you could uh look at uh and consider. So the person who doesn't understand which document can the system can the interface explain. So the the question they have in mind is uh which is reads as what is it? What is written here? What is there in this document? Uh how do I understand it? And so the advantage we have with the intelligence layer of AI which is something we want to explore is the uh ability to infer context of that user locally on that device and then uh speak out to them. So some of these are some experiments and we have some demos of these we are trying to build and uh so uh so you will see some of these uh uh demos that's uh so even in a site uh we want to bring in these are some future future uh looking uh ideas. So how if you look at most language things there is a small button where you switch between English or another language or whatever your preferred languages. But uh what we want to try out and we are is in a very early stage is if I can use a formal language which is like English and associate with a secondary a bilingual language which has an explainer. So when I hover on it, I should be able to it should tell me okay what do I find out here in this uh uh site. So it should be able to explain. I think that is a huge benefit that AI offers. And so these are some of the uh directions we are thinking uh in terms of improving inclusion accessibility for a very heterogeneous population. Uh so I I I think what are the opportunities and like Sabuji said we need to invite we invite industry and uh experts to collaborate and help us with some of these and uh I would request my colleague Zach to show you the path and how you could work with UID. Thank you. >> Thank you sir. Good afternoon everyone. Uh it's a pleasure to be able to do this on behalf of UIDI and thanks for joining. Um so when we are here we feel like an AI organization but it's not wrong we have AI already UID.AI so we can call ourselves an AI first organization. Okay. While sir was talking about uh the ideas of implementation, I just want to talk about few initiatives that we have been trying to get started which might be useful for the community at large. But just before that I just have a question. How many of you a show of hands please if you use you have used AI to free yourself up maybe write an email. Okay. Okay. That's at least 70%age of the audience. Thanks. You had done this. You raised your hands because you were intending to free yourself up. And how many of you actually became free because of that? Well, that is not even 20%age. Now, this is what the ident is what is the AI paradox we're talking about, right? We think that we're going to achieve something but at this a flip side to it, right? Uh when it comes to identity, it's the same problem. We actually have a lot of opportunities with AI but we also see a lot of challenges like Sabul Sur just said and it is a shared responsibility that means UIDI might not do everything themselves it has to be done by the ecosystem right and I'm sure that can be done if we do due diligence to any verification any authentication that is done it can be done really well while we are here we keep listening to a lot of ideas ideas related to AI related to address update I'm not able to do this I'm not able to do that it's good but could that actually be done at the you know at the source itself it could be and that's what I think AI implementation and the edge really helps right okay so we want we actually see a lot of companies who are AI companies who want to work closely with us and what we're doing now is make innovation possible from the community itself right and I think it's a very famous uh word that we use open innovation open innovation is done not by a single organization but done by the ecosystem and I just want to tell you how we are making it possible while the core work would be done by UIDI the other augmented work can be done by the ecosystem so just a few initiatives. We we call it ID AON and ID AON just rebranded as ID AON. Uh recently we did launch an update to our old old Amadada app. We call it the Aadhaar app and I think if most of you have not installed it, please do that. It has a huge benefit to what you'll be able to get once you start using it. And we're not going to explain that today. It is not about the Aadhaar app. But please feel to reach out to us if you have doubts. The idea aims to bring ideas. We we create an ecosystem called the verification ecosystem or the ovsc's. OBSC's stand for offline verification seeking entities. So we used to do authentication all this while. Now we are actually also creating a verification ecosystem to do verification through the Aadhaar app. So when you go to a hotel, people are still asking you to provide your Aadhaar card for identity. You don't probably have to do that in future. You just go scan a QR, it becomes like a UPI transaction. You scan a QR, you share the details, you approve the details, you're going to share maybe your name and address and it goes to their back end and it is secured there. There is no paper. It is paperless. Right? And this is not just a hottle thing. It could be done in multiple sectors. we did something to bring out the use cases and I think there's a huge opportunity for AI to do a fantastic job if there are a lot more ideas. The other thing for AI community is we always keep seeing that we need data and what UI has done is they have put the anonymized data sets completely out into the data.gov gov portal which can be analyzed. You could probably create a get a lot of insights on top of which you can actually build AI solutions. So these two things please keep a lookout. We have um we have shortlisted entities. We also have reward programs associated with it. Maybe this would be a great way to start working in these areas on on using the data hackathons as well as the ideathons. We also have done something very unique which probably no identity provider has done. We've opened uh a sandbox into which you can actually through which you can actually get access to the APIs, test your application, integrate it, test it and see whether you can build a new workflow process for your own organization. And this is something that you'll have to also tell us what you need from a sandbox. We have started it. It is open to you. You can register now just go to the sandbox.uida.goav.in and start uh using it. So this is something that we would like you to use and I think in future we would have more challenges in the sandbox. For example, we are looking at contactless biometrics. We're looking at a possible way to kind of uh counter defects. How how do we get the AI community to work with us closely to address defects? We also did one more very very unique thing. It's called Sitha. It's it's called the same scheme for innovation and technology association with ADAR. It is a funded program. We are piloting it today. And this is both the startups as well as the academia. And what is the advantage is if you look at today in India we are lacking an identity technology ecosystem to be developed and it it is something when you see so many people so many AI companies I think it is a huge possibility for companies to add value to identity and it can be done through a program like this and I would request if there's any companies who would like to work closely with us please look at this program there would be lot of new cohorts coming new problem statements ments coming. We have three problem statements just for information. For example, for academia, we have a presentation attack detection. What what research can be done for countering presentation attacks? Please look up what the term means. Contactless fingerprints. We've always been touch-based, right? We've been using fingerprints for a touch-based sensor. But right now, can I use a mobile phone to kind of authenticate? We're looking at building something in addition to the face. We are also looking at face livveness. Very important to make sure that you're alive and you're the person that's authenticating and verifying. So all these challenges are now open. It's not just solved alone by UID. It's solved together. So just want to touch upon this while we build this new app. I would request you to kindly um install the app. But we would like to see a lot more use cases coming, lot more innovations coming and lot more secure you know workflows to be created in every sector. So this is what I'd like you to like like you to take back and just leave with a thought that it's a shared responsibility that we have and please work closely with us because now a lot is open for you to work together with us. Yes. Thank you to all our speakers for that extremely insightful session. It truly opened up new perspectives on Aadhaar, its many dimensions, its evolving architecture and what it offers for the AI ecosystem. Before we go into the next session to give a glimpse into the Aadhaar journey and the tremendous impact it has created across the country, it is my privilege to invite Shri Bhuvanesh Kumar IAS CEO Unique identification authority of India to the stage. Sir, may I request you to please take the stage. Thank you Albert. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Uh first of all thank you my colleagues from the technology center at Bangaluru G Tanushi Bharma uh brother Prasad Sabut and other colleagues uh who have made presentation. I'm sure many of you would be interested in uh some of these activities and apart from what has been explained there is another scheme called SITA which is basic for scheme for innovation on technology based on Aadhaar. So many of these startups are engaged with us academia is associated with us. In fact, we recently had a discussion and our authority chairperson and members are keen to expand the scope of Sitha and include more participation in that and maybe look at doing grant funding as well as equity funding for the startups to look at the innovations that can happen along with the Aadhaar. Now there are I mean the the topic which we started with the identity paradox actually to me many times Aadhaar has lot of myths and there are many paradoxes. So how many of you are having Aadhaar here? Almost everybody has an Aadhaar. How many of you remember your Aadhaar? Remember your Aadhaar? I'm asking the 12 digits. Oh very large number of people remember it. I'm I'm quite surprised. Pleasantly surprised. Most people think Aadhaar is a card and that's how they treat it. And that's unfortunate. It's a paradoxical situation. Aadhaar is not supposed to be a card. Aadhaar is actually only a 12digit number and that is how it was supposed to be. But over the years it has become a document instead of a number. By law it's still a number, not a document. But it is being mostly used as a document. Wherever you go, people will say, "Show me your Aadhaar, show me your Aadhaar." On the other hand, people should tell me your Aadhaar. Right? Nobody says, "Tell me your Aadhaar." Everybody says, "Show me your Aadhaar." And most of the people use the Aadhaar in terms of photocopies and they keep your 12-digit Aadhaar number. On the other hand, that is not the way it is supposed to be. The identity verification of an individual should should happen only by telling the number and then the requesting entity is able to get the information about you as an individual. They should not retain the number. The number belongs to you and it should retain be retained by you only and nobody else. And there is a risk when you part with your number and give it to somebody else and somebody else now has multiple factors of information about you. They have your Aadhaar number and they also have the demographic information like the name, the date of birth and also your image which makes it actually prone to risk and then there are possibilities of frauds happening and that's why we thought of changing the way Aadhaar is being used and brought the Aadhaar app and through the Aadhaar app when Aadhaar is shared actually Aadhaar is not shared it's only the demographic information which is shared and that is what proves choose the identity. The purpose of having a foundational identity was to prove your identity and do nothing else. So this is one of the first paradoxes or the myths about Aadhaar. The second myth which goes with Aadhaar in most circumstances and recently we found when one of the government authorities issued a notification telling the students to update their father's name in Aadhaar. And let me tell you there is no column for father's name in Aadhaar. There is no such column. It doesn't contain father's name. So some of you might be putting it in the address field saying son of so and so care of so and so in the address field but there is no field because Aadhaar as Sabat was mentioning uh it's it's a huge organization in terms of the numbers but it's a very lean organization in terms of data. The total number of fields in Aadhar is about nine. That's all. So there are three fields of the biometrics. The face, fingerprints and iris. These are the three biometric fields which are captured once never go out of the system remain securely as one single packet. And that is one of the limitations of open and they're kept as one single packet. They're not separated. The iris and fingerprints and the face are never separated from one another. They remain together as one single unit and that's it. That is what makes it secure. And the other four fields which are name, gender, date of birth and address are the demographic information and two fields are optional and mobile and email. So if you want to provide the mobile and email, it is up to you. If you don't want to provide, it still works. So the second myth is that Aadhaar has got lot of data. No, it's a very very data lean organization. It works very securely. Biometrics once brought into a system never go out. The law says so. The biometrics cannot be shared with anybody under any circumstances. And it is used as one toone authentication. That means if you tell your Aadhaar number to any requesting entity and also give one of the biometrics or maybe mobile OTP. So two attributes on the basis of which identity authentication or verification will happen. The requesting entity makes a request back to back to UIDI. Now this is something which is limiting that if Aadhaar authentication has to be happen then the Aadhaar number holder has to provide that information to the requesting entity and then the requesting entity has to make a request back to back to UIDI and this is limiting in terms of numbers. This is limiting in terms of the infrastructure required, the audits, the security and all those challenges and the onboarding process being long and that is why it was very important to uh democratize the identity verification rather than keeping that power with UIDI only all the time and giving authentication from here. We changed the thought process and we said we are going to provide verified credentials to Aadhaar number holders digitally in the Aadhaar app and then they can share these verified credentials to all those entities which are looking for identity verification without their need to coming back to UI. They need not come the offline verification seeking entities need not come to UI for any kind of an identity verification. UI has been uh ahead of the technological curve most of the times and right from the beginning has been using artificial intelligence in many ways. Of course with the new large language models and generative AI coming into picture things have changed and the progress has been very very fast. Many of these things have been adopted into the system and you saw through demonstrations including the customer relation management, the biometric fraud detection and the livveness checking. In fact, the the next step could be the legacy document verification. We've seen many of the people who have sent provided us the documents as proof of identity or proof of address have given us document which are really not genuine. Uh they could be either fake or could be fraudulently obtained. So they can be both the document doesn't exist at all or it exists but has been obtained wrongly and they have submitted those documents. So that's that's a great area where new work can happen and I'm sure many of you would have worked on those sites where you have done um image matchings uh and the image matching softwares through AI use of AI are available and that is one area we are looking at as a potential area for future collaborations. the face livveness uh the in-house development of face authentication uh has been done by UIDI but at the same time we recognize the potential risks in face authentication and people trying to bypass that system and and trying trying to do various kinds of presentation attacks through the videos or through masks and all those things so we engaged with some of the startups they have done uh wonderful work uh but I'm sure there is more scope in this area The world is asking for the face recognition system developed by UIDI and recently we we have opened it up. This is the first time we are opening the SDK of our base RD application to the world and we are saying that okay we will work together and also look at the pads the presentation attack side and work with the startups all those who are in this area to make it far more stronger so that the uh livveness is not manipulated and people are able to use it safely and securely. So some of these areas are extremely important areas and AI is going to play a very very important role in all of these. So whatever we can do inhouse I think for other than that we have to go beyond and look at people who can participate. Today only we received actually a query and interest from the Anusandhan National Research Foundation ANRF. So, ANRF is keen to do research jointly with UIDI and there there are I think more than 20 odd entities which are already working in the sandbox which was displayed here. Uh the UIDI sandbox which we opened last year in April. It has been existence and many of the authentication user agencies and and the banks and fintexs and biometric uh uh doing biometric uh entities they're all doing research. In fact, many of you perhaps may not be even knowing we have uh roughly two cr anonymized biometric data which we can use for testing any kind of uh application biometric identification system applications ABS applications and in case any of you are working on those areas then you can come back you can bring your models we we will obviously cannot share this data with anybody but this data is available in a sandbox you bring your model into the sandbox You run the model, you see the results, you fine-tune it, take your results and your model back without taking the data away. And that's what is available. I think it's it's a strong platform which is available for people to come and work on. And this is this is unique. I I don't think anybody else in the world will be having that kind of a data to work on. And so if you're working on any of the AI models on the biometrics, you're most welcome. without taking too much of time and because we have the panelists and we are going to hear them. Uh I really want to thank you all for showing your keen interest coming this afternoon to this session joining with us and please do write to us if there is anything that we have not been able to tell you and you still have queries we'll be happy to answer you back. Thank you so much Jane. Thank you so much sir for sharing your thoughts and showing us what Aadhaar could mean for us and what it has in store for us in the coming days. As we continue this conversation on AI and its impact on ID tech and the digital public infrastructure, we now move to what promises to be a highly engaging and thoughtprovoking panel discussion. We are privileged to have with us eminent leaders from across the IDTech and DPI landscape, innovators, policy makers, academicians, and technology builders who are shaping the future of trusted digital identity. Before I invite the panelist, we'll take two minutes for the stage to be set and as soon as it is done, we will be inviting the panelist over. It is my honor to invite our distinguished panelist to the stage. First, may I request our moderator for the day, Mr. Daniel Abadi, head of technology and partnerships at the center of for digital public infrastructure and former under secretary of digital government, government of Argentina to kindly join us on the stage. I would also like to invite the other panelists Shrimati Tanushi De BMAS deputy director general technology development unique identification authority of India Shri Kdar Kulkarni co-founder and CEO of hypergea professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Jthur and Shri Varun Chhataji co-founder and CTO of seven sense please join the panel and with that now I hand over the session to you Mr. >> Thank you. Hello good afternoon to everyone. Uh first of all congratulation to UAGI uh for showing the progress and showing things actually it's really hard to do things in government and no matter that India is one of the leading countries in this space we need to celebrate that so congratulations again. Um, so I think we're going to take these next 30 minutes to chat about AI and basically ID touch. We got four great panelists, uh, people that really know their things and they're really good on what they do. So I'm going to go directly to the questions and if we have time, we're going to have open to questions. So, Professor Mayak, uh, as AI becomes more powerful, both improving authentication and creating risks like deep fakes, how is UI thinking about staying ahead while ensuring trust in the system? So um with respect to UIDI or Aadhaar uh this is this has been in in in in in the discussions not now mean defix is like in in 2019 20 2020 onwards that has become more prevalent but uh when we were uh discussing about u establishing such a system in 2009 2010 time frame when no one was talking about being responsible being trustworthy we were actually discussing about how to make this entire system secure, trustworthy, reliable, foolproof. Right? So, so, so, so since 2009 2010 time frame uh we ensured that the systems that we develop or the the entire ecosystem that is developed is is reliable, it's trustworthy and and that's where the whole design principles uh have been in in Aadhaar. uh I would say in in the bloodstream of Aadhaar the uh the whole ecosystem has to that the the way design has been built that the whole ecosystem has to evolve with respect to trustworthy being trustworthy. Now with respect to the recent threats recent uh uh or of the newer threats that are coming in uh Aadhar has been discussing how to actually evolve and some of the things that you have seen over here today and in fact uh uh uh as a committee we are also discussing that how what is the future and in in the future how we will evolve the whole uh um being more trustworthy more secure uh and how to actually follow the seven sutras of being responsible >> that's great and especially on the idea of designing principles from the beginning like designing for scale instead of scaling what you have tests and I'm going to go into honestry but then go into the private sector people say so I heard you talk about you know creating you know models in UDI that work with high accuracy on biometrics to prevent fraud. Can you walk us through that strategy and like to build on top of of what professor had saw? >> Sure. So um right from the beginning um we understood the importance of going paperless meant and presenceless meant being able to identify the person even though they were not there. My previous colleague mentioned that earlier the proof of presence was treated by the eye and your agent but how much can you tr you know trust your agent on source. So slowly becoming paperless and presenceless had to be done through machines and that's how you would achieve scale. So right from the beginning we ensured that the quality of the biometrics that you collect the segmentation what part of the biometrics you are capturing the saving of the same through vectorized formats and thereafter making sure that what you are collecting is live and then making sure what you have collected is dduplicated across a very large gallery and then you identify okay this is the unique person that has come into my system. Later when he comes for authentication, you make sure that over a very high accuracy rate, you can detect him to be live when he places his finger, iris or his face and then ensure with high accuracy and very low false positive rates, making sure that he's identified with himself using his Aadhaar number. So the entire life cycle of capturing livveness detection saving and then matching has completely been done inhouse and made sure with high accuracy rates inclusive simple design and making sure uh fake proof >> that's great and you talk about trust and accuracy and I want to go into now some risks like going to header like across the market you have working like which fraud trend is evolving the fastest right now and why should we be paying attention to it. Yeah, I think before I start I think a huge round of applause there are two systems that anywhere you go in the world you always feel proud about. One is Aadhaar UIDI. I think everywhere you go in the world, you feel proud as an Indian that every other system. You feel it's like at least three years or five years behind us and the other is UPI, right? I think someone was explaining me crypto and you know you can do these instant transactions and all. Have you come to India? You can do a 10 rupee transaction and and you don't get charged anything. So I think we are I think leading the world in terms of digital public infrastructure. A big credit to all people here. Um, Hyperverge works with financial services organizations across the world. Uh, in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, uh, US. One of the things that we see is usually fraud is something that starts in one part of the world and slowly we see it moving to other parts of the world. Deep fake currently is the biggest u fraud movement that we see. We saw it start in Indonesia about two years back. We work very closely with Grab and some entities there and we started seeing these attacks there. We started building for it and now we start seeing attacks in India. I really like to spend a lot of time uh with these teams because we want to be as close to the user. So recently with one of the largest private banks, we saw this very interesting case where a person has taken a perfect picture. He's smiling and everything is good and it looks like he has taken it with his front camera but then when you closely watch the picture both his hands are behind him. So you're like how is he taking a front pick with the because the only way you are allowed to go forward is when you can use the front camera of your cell phone. So how is he using the front camera of a cell phone and having both his hands at the back. So these are the kind of uh interesting cases that we see. the other kind of frauds that we are now starting to see in India. Um so in any crime usually you know we say hey it's not the outsiders uh family has an equal role to play in crimes right a lot of times we believe crimes happen with people where an outsider is involved so this is a classic example the wife would be sleeping and the husband needs a loan and he doesn't want to tell her he needs a loan but you know very quickly he would go put her Aadhaar number and just take a picture of her or she might be cooking and he would just say just look at this for one minute I just need you know I'm doing some application. So her intention is not to get a loan but she ends up being the person who ends up uh on whose name on whose credit rating the loan happens right. So we usually see these trends for some reason we see them emerging in Southeast Asia a lot more and then moving to places like India. The other funny thing that I see with financial services organizations, right? I think Indian marriages are extremely famous, right? We have big fat Indian weddings and it always goes two ways, right? Either you have a big budget in mind and then you share it with your parents and who if they are financing it eventually a lot of things get cut down or it goes the other way around. You start with a small project and it goes beyond size. Um so one of the common thre threads that we observe is organizations start with I need all protection and usually this protection in the AI world if you think about there is no one engine that is preventing fraud right um like a Mosart Vienna orchestra where there are 30 people playing in case of hyperverge we have about 40 engines that are working in the background to prevent frauds right like livveness presentation attacks deep fakes quality checks checks that we mentioned document forgery checks. So there are 40 engines that are working in the background and every time we call each one of them it costs us. So we give you know we can give full protection at this price. And usually people say this is all good but I don't think I need all this protection. I need I can pay you only so much. So we say if you can pay me only so much in your marriage only five people can play. You can't have 35 people playing. And it gets started like that. But eventually in another month's time, 6 months time, we are sitting with the fraud team. They are saying how can hyperverge pass all of these cases. All of these are frauds. How did you allow this to happen? We said see all of these checks we have recommended. These are the six emails that we have sent you saying please enable them. You have not enabled them. Then the fraud team says you know what I'm going to make the business and procurement team enable all of this. So eventually it all gets enabled and the whole orchestra plays and the wedding goes well. But but that's the pattern that we see. So the message on fraud to organizations is like in a defense situation, right? We don't start preparing once the attack happens. We can prepare, we should have it tested. Maybe we are not rolling it out full scale, but we should have them ready to fire, right? At any point if we need them to fire, we should have all our systems ready to fire. So that's the key message on fraud that I've seen. >> Yeah. Perfect. And it's super interesting how a trend it's a like deep fake is two years now in time. It's not like the last month. So and moving now into baroon on like with all the benefits of biometrics as an enabler for digital identities for identity systems like what are some of the challenges around using bometrics for identity proofing like how do you envision this? >> Yeah. So I'm coming at this from a slightly different angle. Um my startup seven sense is dealing with privacy enhancing technologies and while we do deal with biometrics our angle is to enable to keep biometrics as an enabler but still protect the biometrics. So the biggest challenge is I I think maybe I can talk about three challenges. So the first challenge is that biometrics are not revocable or renewable. Right? If you have your fingerprint, you have your face, you have your iris, you cannot change it, right? So while there are stringent protections that organizations like UIDI have around that data, it is still a risk inherent risk that despite all the protections, despite all the security, there is still a risk that if that data is lost, it can never be regained again. It cannot be changed. You cannot change your face. You cannot change your fingerprint. Ideally, you would want to ideally you would want your biometrics to serve just like a password. So, if I want if my password is compromised, I can change my password. But I can't change my biometrics. So, this is one core challenge and it is not insurmountable. As a matter of fact, there are standards that are out there. There are organizations that are working in this area in this area of privacy enhancing technologies where you have something known as a renewable biometric reference. So instead of a biometric reference being a template being a feature vector, you have a renewable biometric reference where you take the biometric and you add some entropy to it and you create a representation which is not biometric. So in our case of course in in the case of privacy enhancing technologies you can have biometric derived representations or you can have completely different representations. So in in the case of seven sense we mold or rather we operate at the se intersection of machine learning cryptography and biometrics. So face is our primary factor though we can also um protect other biometric factors with the face. Um and what we do is we derive a key from the face and we encrypt your PII with it and then at the point of verification if we can derive the key to decrypt it then through the act of decryption you are verified. So this is uh bringing together biometrics, cryptography and machine learning to create this renewable biometric system which protects biometric templates yet still enables the system to use biometrics. The second one that I see the challenge is that with privacy legislation like the DPDPA and like we've had with GDPR and PDPA in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, there is always a purpose limitation around the collection of biometrics, right? or organizations like UIDI have the Aadhaar Act under which they operate and biometric data is always collected for very specific purposes. For example, in the Aadhar act it is for two specific purposes. One is for the creation of the Aadhaar and the other one is for the verification of the Aadhaar and therefore that biometric data is sacrosanked. It lives within the central identity data repository. It is never allowed to go outside. But with privacy-enhancing technologies, that same biometric data can be used to enable organizations to interact with that biometric data as an enabler but still without having access to the direct biometric data. So the my biometric data for hyperge will be different. My biometric data for IIT will be different for PAN will be different for banks will be different and each of these will be able to verify me with my biometrics without touching my biometrics and of course the the basic attributes have been already enabled in in the Aadhaar app where now I can present my verifiable credential to these organizations. However, the act of verifying um via biometrics also is also enabled with offline verification seeking entities. Now, but there are other cases for example we worked in rural India where one is to1 verification was not feasible for attendance taking because there are 50 people there are 10 people that you need to take the attendance for and if you go and say what is your Aadhaar number I want to take your picture. Okay, you are verified. You enter, enter, enter, enter enter. So 1 is to N is obviously not within the mandate of Aadhaar. But once you have that 1 is to1 verification with Aadhaar, privacy enhancing technologies like ours can enable even 1 is to N in certain circumstances. So I think I was going to speak about three challenges, but I think I'll stop with just two because I've taken up a lot of time and I'll pass it back to Dan. >> Thank you. I think that's super interesting and I want to keep in the biometrics part and go come back to you tennis on like you've been working a lot on biometrics due to application how how you envision this as a DPI >> so um what we have done over the years is we have partnered with various organizations to make sure that the technology has not been limited to UID uh with the collaboration with MOSIP uh with collaboration with many other countries who are we see the Kenyan delegation right here. Um and many more countries. Um even today our CEO had to step out because he had a meeting with Bolivia in the morning. He has hosted vice president of socials and we have been leading the global south and not just that uh developing countries and developed countries alike and explaining to them and handholding them to adopt this technology. So that consultative approach and collaborative approach has always been there. In terms of the technology, we have always been an open house, open-source house and we made sure that the technologies that we adopted were from the community and brought back to the community. U what where we are going now is like our CEO mentioned in his previous talk that um some of the technologies were very core to private companies. In fact, UIDAI itself today uses three vendors to use um the dduplication process. But we have now the capability of doing it inhouse and we have got very good results. Um at least over the 18 plus population we have accuracies much better than the best of the companies. We are now trying to expand that model and make sure that for the use cases of UIDI where we collect biometrics above five years of age it it expands at the same scale and better. Uh while we are in that process we are consulting with uh we want to reach out to companies who can become u uh the conduits or help us in consulting with various other countries who want to adopt this technology. Open source it but at the same time give the support for adoption. uh if required for uh uh you know uh technology diffusion as we call it. So we're hoping that we'll be able to take it out to the world the AIS as we call it and use it as a DPI right out of India's uh stack. >> Thank you. So keeping I'm going to go into now to the to professor Maya and then go like I'm going keeping into other and then going more to the industry view. So running a government service it's like critical infrastructure like once you're live like you deliver services to citizens you cannot have you cannot have a shutdown because people can you know don't access to services so how do you work in UDI on like to approach fairness inclusion and responsible governance as you include AI into the authentication process like how do You embed the safeguards now that AI has come to like enhance authentication let's say that way see we have to understand now that UIDI has a 15 more than 15 years of history now and when I say history it's like memory right we have we have a lot of uh experience um and and I'll actually get to quot uh an interesting example where when again 2019 9 2010 time frame. Uh we were involved when we were doing the P and when we realized that when we reached to a particular state the face quality match was not working because the the the way the quality thresholds were set they were set for a particular sub ggeography within India. But when we reach to the another state the quality thresholds are like rejecting all the faces and given as as CEO mentioned Bureshi mentioned that all the three biometric modalities are packed together. If one is rejected the entire packet is rejected. So we had to actually go back to the field and to figure out what what is wrong what went wrong. So so initially we set the thresholds way too high the quality parameters way too high. when then when then we looked at the parameters when we looked at all the values from that state what was wrong we adjusted it and and these kinds of adjustments would have happened over the years in UIDI across different modalities different application domains so it's a huge amount of corpus of knowledge that UI has so now and and when we talk about artificial intelligence growth of artificial intelligence we have to also understand that AI use of AI in biometrics and Aadhaar as a whole would would be incomplete if we don't use this knowledge right and that's where this whole open ecosystem that Aadhaar has is very important to to uh take a look at what learnings Aadhaar has like collected over the years has solved so many problems uh and and like we all are accessing Aadhaar on a day in dayout basis like millions of uh um uh transactions through Aadhaar is happening So, so this whole ecosystem has now so much knowledge that the domain contextdriven artificial intelligence can really take the Aadhaar to the next step and that's what we are actually looking at how what is the future of Aadhaar and how we go forward and that's where this whole knowledge base would be very very useful >> great >> and I just want to come in here um >> so like uh professor Mank was mentioning um when we train our models the we have the advantage of temporal shifts the person has um joined uh UIDI as a 5-year-old kid over next 15 years he has done his biometric updates and we know exactly how his face progresses so when UIDI says that I can match faces over years of uh you know person's aging we actually mean it because nobody else will have a progression of a person from 5 to 15 because We've been functional for 15 years and again at 15 to 30 and therefore in fact irrespective of that we use face much more reliably than fingers and irises because they age much more um uh faster in terms of matching uh comparison. So even though we use all the three parameters together but face has a very high um uh you know uh matching rate even over the years. In fact for elderly the fingers deteriorate but their face is very very matchable till they become you know uh 90 99. >> Totally agree. I I always joke around with promote when I say I come from a country that has dig identity ID like forever but for me like it's 45 million people is like your sandbox >> so that's like our testing yeah >> so yeah so I will talk about that but going into the knowledge of the ecosystem so going to get our um what have you seen consistently driving meaningful conversion gains without materially will be increasing the the risk fraud like yeah I think great question if we are extremely strict no user will go through and if we are extremely lenient we will convert a lot of users but a lot of them would be fraud so it's a balance the one thing I always feel right if you see the ecosystem we have the end user who is trying to open an account or who is trying to get access to some financial service then we have the regulated entity then we have a tech company which could be like hyperverge we have government of India we have regulator and then we also have the digital public infrastructure so it's a so many stakeholders are involved in this process and every stakeholder is bringing some important boundary conditions the regulator is bringing boundary conditions on fraud etc etc something thing that I observed right when we are a startup we are sitting out of client's office we are seeing every application and we are solving every problem somewhere as you have 10 clients you know you start sitting out of your office more when you have 50 clients then you are a lot of times you are just looking at excel sheets and telling the board this is the number this quarter that is the number that quarter so even the role I play I felt at a certain scale you are managing so many internal problems that we somehow forget whom do we serve and if we calmly look at it whom do we all serve we finally serve that end user the common Indian who is trying to avail the services right when there are so many stakeholders it's very difficult to keep a track that that's the person we are serving so when I say conversion rate right conversion rate for a registered entity may mean that if we improve it by 1% their topline increases by like a million dollars right for someone like a midsize NBFC may increase by a million dollars. But if we think of it from a end user's perspective, right, it could be a a pensioner who is sitting at the home. It could be someone who is uh extremely excited that they will get onto a brokerage and they will start their trading right now in a tier three. So it is all of these people that we are serving. My biggest lesson has been um every week spend time with whom do you serve, right? So the rule for me breaks down to if I am meeting because I can't directly meet the customer. I can't run around on the road and say who is doing other authentication I need to check it or who is doing KYC and I need to sit with you. But one easy way to do it is at least sit out of offices of banks, NBFCs, brokerages and look at data right personally look at data not what my team is telling me not what their team is telling me just calmly looking at data seeing hey what's the problem what are the people who are the people who are stuck in the queue right now and I think the amount of insights that gives where I see the customer facing problems directly we all are people who can then say if this is a problem for this customer who else is a problem for and we can go out there and solve it. Um so every time I personally I feel I spend time on conversion rate I'm helping that Indian who is doing uh onboarding or the Southeast Asian who is doing onboarding who doesn't have the voice to reach me directly perfect and that's you give me so you mentioned KYC which is not your client and I want to go to Barun because I was reading previous to the session defining the question with all of you like you So I going to talk about agents that we haven't mentioned in this session but now we are like in an agent world and we're going into the agents world like how do you see like delegation of identity and know your agent beside know your clients like how how we going to navigate this? So this is uh I mean this is a very future-looking sort of question because we have just started using agentic AI uh this year we already even seven sense we started building code using agents right so the question is like when an agent an AI agent is acting on your behalf for in the example of code for example when you're checking in it's your identity that is checking in that code. Ostensibly that code is written by you. So I'm just using this technical example but as agentic use becomes more prevalent agents will do more right they will act on your behalf to open bank accounts. They will act on your behalf to write emails and this is coming right I mean we have to pay attention to it now. So if an agent is acting on your behalf then the agent has to somehow represent you and today I have an identity as an Aadhaar holder but now if I have agents agentic AI um which is opening a bank account for me which is booking my travels for me I don't want to share my Aadhaar number through that agent maybe right and how does that agent get authenticated and that agent tomorrow may spawn even more agents. So again going back to the technical example, I have personally used a team of agents where I had one team lead, one agent acting as a UIUX developer, one agent acting as an Android developer, one agent acting as an iOS developer. And I said here are my specs, go write the software. And this entire software which would have taken about six months to develop took about maybe two hours. And from the UI, UX, iOS app, Android app, um back end, front end, everything was done in two hours. It would have taken four to six months. And this is going to become even more pervasive in other industries. Just now the technology industry is early as an early adopter. But this will happen. This is coming. So how does the delegation of identity work? Right? I have an Aadhaar number or I have some root of trust and how do I say that okay you are my agent and you can act on my behalf to open a bank account. How does the bank trust that um identity? So for this you need a chain of trust and again I will go back a little bit to what seven sense does which is bringing um machine learning and cryptography together. So the internet does this really well. you have certificate authorities those are the root of trust. So even if you like have a company in India or have bid for an government tender you actually get this hardware security module which contains your private key. Now you use this private key to sign something and you also with this private key you get a digital certificate. So this is exactly how the internet also works. their certificate authorities they will say okay hyperverge.com belongs to such and such ident uh registered entity we have verified the entity therefore we can give you an SSL certificate for hyperverge.com and thereafter when I interact with hyperverge.com I can verify that certificate or rather my browser verifies that certificate and now if you see that there is a delegation of identity already happening where you got maybe the hyperge certificate from an organization like um I don't know digert or entrust and they did that initial verification and then they gave you that certificate and there can be some intermediary uh certificate authorities in this chain as well. So the same technology can apply for agents as well where you have the root certificate um which is the Aadhaar certificate which issues me my identity certificate and I issue my agent an identity certificate and that agent can go and issue sub agents identity certificates and this entire chain of trust is verifiable through cryptography. Another interesting thing that this brings into the fray is something that is being overlooked at the moment and it will become increasingly important over the next 10 to 20 years which is postquantum cryptography. So today's identity systems the cryptography they are using is often RSA or elliptic curve or like basically these are technologies that are broken by advanced quantum computers by something known as shores algorithm. So if you in the future if you have a public key and a sufficiently powerful quantum computer from the public key you will be able to derive a private key. So all cryptography is broken in the future. So what are organizations do rather let me not say organizations what are states doing? I mean behind the scenes every state has some espionage unit. States are harnessing data, right? China is looking at data, US is looking at data. Just they're capturing the data. They can't decrypt it right now. Your bank transactions that are happening, everything that every interaction that you have today is being recorded somewhere. And that data will become plain text data in maybe 10 or 20 years. So this is another important theme that ID systems need to pick up is to bring in postquantum cryptography into the mix. Your verifiable credential that resides in the Aadhaar act uh Aadhaar app sorry will be signed by a traditional algorithm today but NIST has already standardized a few algorithms. NIST is the National Institute of Standards Technology USA. They have already certified and standardized a few algorithms such as module latis key encapsulation mechanism, module latis digital signing algorithm. These are already standards and they can be adopted today and seven sense is also working with the internet engineering task force to define the standards of these certificates. But in the case of seven sense, what is unique is that these certificates that I'm talking about contain a public key that is derived from a face. So now we have all the benefits of public key infrastructure from document signing from transaction au authentication from passwordless login you have all the applications that are available on the internet that rely on cryptography but now we bring biometrics into the fray and all of those transactions signing encryption decryption passwordless login are all can all use your face as an authentication factor and use postquantum cryptography in the chain of trust. >> Thank you. Um it's I'm I'm curious. I'm conscious about time. I think we have passed the time. I want to thank our great panelists like a great vision from the public sector from the private sector. So big round of applause for them and thank you so much. Dan, can I add something as a closing comment? >> Uh, yes, please. >> Okay, so for all of us, I think >> you got one minute. >> Yeah, I take 30 seconds. Sorry for the previous long runs. I think the first I have a 3 and a half year old and I think even when she was very small, maybe 6 months or a year old, midnight, it's 2 am, 2 am, 3:00 a.m., she recognizes her mother even without opening her eyes, right? As in at night she wakes up, drinks milk >> and sleeps off. >> And imagine a day when your mother doesn't recognize you, right? You'll be horrified, right? Like because that's one person you expect. No matter who else doesn't recognize you, your mom should recognize you. >> The Alzheimer panel, it's in the other pavilion. Let's let's go with that. >> No, I feel uh every time you know a user is not recognized, they're a legitimate user and they are facing friction with identity of any kind, right? You want to open account something like that. In a way it's like your mother not recognizing you. In India we call India as bhat mata. So we call it a mother. So I think the friction if we can make it we should constantly be on a mission to reduce the friction. I think mother India should always recognize her kids. >> Great. Thank you. I think it's yeah I think the narrative is basically how other creating an ecosystem where we can have innovators creating services and all this. But again, congrats to the heart. I know you do it so simple and tell it so simple and beautiful and smart, but just like 15 years of hard work and so thank you all and thank you all. >> Thank you everyone for being a part of this. Thank you. >> Thank you. Thank you so much to our esteemed panelist and a distinguished panel uh for enriching us with that you know insightful session. As a token of our appreciation, I request pan ma'am to please hand the uh metos from da to our distinguished panel. I think that's a good idea. Thank you so much once again. Uh, can I request the panels just come forward for a group photo? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you once again to all the speakers, to the panel, to all of you who have joined here. We look shape the next phase of the trusted digital identity in India. Thank you and have a wonderful evening ahead.
