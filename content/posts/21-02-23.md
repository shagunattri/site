The AI Wars

Web3 ,4,5,6,7,8,9, …

Crypto,web3,bitcoin,doge,luna,token,nft,trade,sell,decentralized,dip and dump have been key terms during the 2021-22 lockdown period on elite twitter tech bro communities where everywhere the talk of the town is about how this new technology web3.
Memes, were made money was dumped to create projects and a lot of people casually scrolling through their social feeds got into the web3 and trading crypto for some returns.

It’s like “bath baithe kya Kare , karna he kuch kaam“. and many tried or atleast got them aware about crypto.
Apart from the underlying engineering manpower it takes to build and run a decentralized system or a trading system for that matter is the only thing that made sense during the time.

For me it always felt like the solutions are just being builts because people can as they have new tech to experiment and build but it never really solved for a “real-world“ problem that actually generated some value and eventually
It felt like it was spreading in similar ways to the virus, we are dealing with and this was the hot new thing that is in the market that everyone wanted to jump onto.

But looking at things from the outside it always felt superficial tech and a solution looking for a problem where no one actually willing to pay at the end.

We have seen similar trend cycles in tech where AI was one the top tech to get into, Data Science is another and we this time around it is web3 and crypto.

Looking at these cycles from a macro lens and trying to understand patterns makes me realise how a lot of this was also a sideffect from the money printing the US gov. did, the time on people hand - scrolling feeds all day, willing to explore and learn more things with the extra time at hand.

Tech in general runs in cycles - people see, watch every move , improve and iterate on.

But its good the trends had died out when the looming recession indicators started showing off its true colors. Once people realised 

And the Bad press crypto and SBF web3/FTX saga has a had run off recently also didn’t help from saving the rocking boat.

Based on FTX saga, and how SBF never got arrested for the all the money he lost, the talk after and now all of a sudden we have one of tht biggest fraud being commited but no tangilbe actions from the authorities that suggest that these schemes were made to bring back money that was flowing around and trying to take control.

Trends and interaction generally occur in cycles and can be applied to most things

Look at the economic order and the changes we see in the power struggle between the west and the rest of the world.

Explained in detail by Ray Dalio in his latest book and the animation that make it clear.

Many tangents not too much time to write, sigh

### Web4 and beyond …
We are to see multiple web[x] and how the internet evolves as we move to the automating most tasks and leave decision making to humans. Something that goes in the piloting industry wher the best pilot is autopilot but we still have human pilots to make critical decisions.

I see similar things happening in tech and most places in general.

Something similar that has now taken the tech bro community by storm is the rise of AI tooling and chatbots - thanks to Open AI and ChatGPT

This hype around the space is similar to web3 but atleast it generating value to users in terms improving productivity at the end of the day.

Maybe we can expect somethings similar through the use of:

And its exciting to watch all this unfold with the:
- 3D chess unfolding infront of us with Google and Microsoft and Open AI
- Elon on the sidelines still making headlines on how the AI is not tweaked right and has bias in its LLMs.

Their are inconsistencies but its about how you deal and how many heads you can put together to solve a problem.
Google is in a situation where they now have to step up even though have cash cow generating revenue like no other business model, but boi has Microsoft hit the nail on the head targetting the most lucrative segment of online search and redefine it as we see, taking a piece of Google’s pie and “make them dance.“

Google Bard has been a mess. Their internal investigation and employees telling of the AI being sentient doesn’t help either.
Google has mostly focused on AI for it’s at-scale problems and integrating it across Google products. It was always there but never the most important feature.

Now it’s time to commercialize and bring it front and center.

Google’s AI capabilities are not short of amazing - Google Lens, Google Camera with its images process, Deepmind and more are examples of google can take upto the challenge with Microsoft.

Its about execution now and microsoft has seen good run of successes while google is always stuck or caught up in some mess.

The more I read and learn the more it feels like that power and money can actually move mountains in tech atleast and it true in most situation
Elon using his other company stocks to run twitter and shape free speech as we see it.
