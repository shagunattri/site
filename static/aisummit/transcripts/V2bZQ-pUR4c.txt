We meet at a time when artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept. It is present reality that is fundamentally reshaping how we teach, how students learn, how research is conducted, and how institutions are functioning and operating. From personalized learning pathways and datadriven decision making to intelligent research tools and administrative efficiency, AI is redefining the very architecture of the higher education. However, this transformation is not just about technology. It is about mindsets, ethics, inclusivity and readiness. The key question before academia today is not whether to adopt AI but how to integrate it responsibly so that we build learners who are not only technologically skilled but also critical thinkers, problem solvers and ethical leaders. At ILM University, we strongly believe that universities must act as innovation ecosystems where interdisciplinary learning, industry collaborations, and emerging technologies like AI come together to prepare students for an uncertain yet opportunity future. This session reflects that commitment. Today's discussion bring together diverse perspectives to explore how institutions can evolve, how faculty can be empowered and how learners can be made truly future ready in the age of AI. I'm confident that the insights shared here will spark meaningful dialogues and actionable ideas. Thank you all for being part of this important conversation. We have a galaxy of rich speakers who are here present amidst us. I will briefly introduce all of them to you. We have professor Ashi Senna with us.

[applause] Now I request Mr. Rohit Pansil GI to kindly take it forward as a moderator of the session. Thank you so much. >> Okay. So, thank you very much. Uh we were to do this in 55 minutes out of which the good or the bad news is 15 are over. So, we just have 40 minutes in front of me and I wouldn't let uh the organizer down by by spilling over and you know the next session or whatever uh coming in the way. Uh so uh long and short is uh I have never been surrounded by so much of natural intelligence next to me and to discuss artificial intelligence at that. So uh I'm sure uh some of you would be interested in keeping things very simple and very cogent because each one of them can speak for the next 40 minutes and hold us in in in in absolute spell. So uh let me start with uh you professor Ashir Sina where is your best-selling book? I don't see it. Okay. So, so now that you haven't bought the book, now tell us very specifically who are students here. Could you could you have a show of hands here? Who are students here? Right at the back. What are you doing at the back? You should be in the front. Anyhow, think if it's interesting enough to come here. You might, you know, gain from Ashish's points of view. Likewise, who are educators here? Just to get a sense of the house. Educators. Okay. So here's uh Ashish Sar. Please tell us what is the one advice you'll give to students at the back and educators in front and then we'll move. >> Sure. So um I guess we were having this conversation a couple of minutes back. Um we are what I would say in the vortex of AI disruption. And the vortex of AI disruption means that there's going to be massive changes in very short periods of time. So that means whatever is your competitive advantage today might only last for the next 3 to six months before something new and different comes. So for educational institutions if you don't change well it's an existential risk. If you don't change you will eventually die for students. What it means >> yeah those students out there because >> for students what it means is that you have to adapt. So the most critical um what you need to do for certain is to adapt be highly agile and learn learn as much as you can right so the next couple of years is going to be highly disruptive but you have to spend this time one skill right would be adapt and be agile. Uh sorry to interrupt you sir. Uh we request you for a group photograph first because they would like to give you the frame picture of today's event. Okay. >> So I would extremely sorry for the disruption. >> It's fine. It's just that you have to give us uh five minutes. Absolutely. Absolutely [laughter] sir. Thank you so much for the kindness. [applause] >> You just use AI to make a picture. >> Sorry. Just give me one minute. Yeah. >> Okay. Now that we have got four and a half minutes extra. Uh okay. Now so Ashish you told us and today I'll call you Ashish. I won't call you professor and Ashish up. >> So [clears throat] you said you have to be agile and all of it. Now all students know it. They know that they have to be agile. They know that education institutions are under threat those who don't reboot. So what specific stuff I mean people are using AI anyway? Any anyone who doesn't use AI here in this room ladies and gentlemen? >> Ah say the honest people right? >> Yeah. >> So so people are using AI if that's what you mean by adaptive. Um no I I think uh you need to understand so it is very easy to outsource the thinking part of it the writing part to artificial intelligence which is what I know you know many of us including students and educators are doing but the ability the loss of the ability to think would be by far one of the worst things that you can do because um you know believe it or not a lot of studies are showing that those of us who overuse artificial intelligence including things like writing that if for instance if you're having issues with how do you put together you know a particular sentence and it's very easy for you to get that help your reliance on that becomes too high. So that means you're outsourcing the whole thinking process whether it is you know to do with putting together an essay or solving a math problem and over a period of time your reliance increases. So by agile I mean is having the ability to critically analyze a particular context or a situation and use it to your advantage. There's absolutely no doubt about that that you have to use it because that's what industry is expecting today but it's how human and AI can come together. So you still it's not like you're outsourcing the whole process but maybe towards the end you know refining it. >> Okay. So adapt but for the first time I'm not going to protest uh decrease reliance as he put it. I I I must say that this is a very objectionable point but we get the sense. Okay. So here's the point now next ILM first of all thank you for putting this together and to the principles here seated here we're very happy to have you here now how are you as an institution responding if at all to what Ash just said how are you different in the new AI age professor >> actually whatever we were teaching till say yesterday or last year we were we have to change that approach and the approach that we are adopting now is we are dividing our say courses or syllabi into six parts. The first five parts are the same we were teaching earlier. But the sixth part is we are telling them what you have learned in the first five parts. You have to try to do it through AI. For example, I give you an example. There is Python programming language. All of you are aware you have to learn Python. So suppose I am teaching you Python. You understand the Python. Now you use the artificial intelligence applications to generate like claude to generate the code. And once you have generated the code, you can use the code. Now you could argue that why not straight away use claude. But the point is if you do not know what code it will generate then how you will put together say 20 or 40 snippets of code together to make the application work to solve a critical problem. So you have to learn what you were learning before. But the thing is you must improve your productivity. What I think about AI is it is just a productivity enhancement tool. It it will not take away your jobs but it will take away the jobs of those who do not know AI. So you have to use AI as a productivity tool. You can like coding has been done for the last 20 years. If you are a good coder, you definitely get a good job or you set up your own company. It it will not happen anymore. You have to have the ability to solve the critical problems and you have to have use the AI to put together that code that that is more important. So every course that we are teaching we have embedded this like if we are teaching you databases same we have taught you the database now we'll teach you how to create the entire database like what you were doing in 30 days we are trying to bring that down to say 3 days. So quick question before I turn to my left. Um it's for reason that you are on my right side. Now question is uh you are in computer sciences area but is this model actually being adopted in as an instant case in humanities and other courses as well or is it still to be adapted? No, we we this is we from the coming uh semester that is new academic session we are going to adopt it across the board because the expectation of the industry is such we are regularly having you know interviews being conducted. So and the answer to that is majority of the companies humans are not conducting interviews they have given it to bots. So we have also now t taken a subscription and we are also giving our students practice how to give an interview to ibot. >> So how about how about giving practice to your teachers? Uh what do they really know outside of the computer science department on these matters and how do you enhance it? >> Like I uh we have put together around 30mmies with all the who's and who of technology. So we are enabling our faculty members to be AI ready and getting them certified because uh ultimately they are the ones who have to go in the classroom and get it executed. So it is all train the trainer model. So we are it is a cycle we are getting the faculty ready to execute this plan because if we do not do it I think it's difficult to move forward coming from the next academy. >> So ladies and gentlemen two takeaways already. one Ashish talks about among many other things he can on the students and the need to adapt and to be responsive to the to the issue and of course the professor has pointed out to how it's not just as educators the realm of computer sciences department but all departments uh I'm still not sure how educators are getting these certificates where is this certificate from >> sir all the companies including Microsoft, Google, Nvidia they are all uh upskilling the faculty members because they also understand the same problem because what we suppose the student goes to the industry what they expected the student to do in 30 days they are expecting him to do it in three days >> I hear the industry pushing you guys but I was just wondering if the educators can be this helpful enough to tell us uh this is not being filmed from this side at least from what I can see are you certified are you kind of already certified in some AI related stuff educators here okay 1 2 3 Why is it taking so much time? You're kind of still looking whether we can get to your digil locker or something. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you for being so honest. I mean, this is what matters that if we leave with even one takeaway each, we'll have like five or six uh coming in. So, I'd now turn to my new friend on the left. Uh [clears throat] so so what do you think as as an entrepreneur and a serial entrepreneur uh what's the big opportunity that students and educators can have in this uh in this in your repertoire so that they can ambush you and get some money out of you before you leave? >> Yeah know firstly thank you for having me here. I was overall really aed by the sheer size of the number of people who visited the AI summit and thanks to ILM for having me here. Um I'll start off with the bad news, right? I don't 100% agree with Manish. We were talking about it yesterday. I think AI will take away jobs. Case in point, none of the big tech companies are hiring. U but that being said, I have two silver linings. One is specific to India and and and relevant to you folks. But before that if you look at a the idea of a job there does not exist a job which is just a unilateral set of task task right every job has tons of tasks that go well beyond what is guard rail by a job description. So when AI comes in and when people talk about AI is going to take away jobs it is going to take away tasks. The question for you is to figure out what is the one thing that you're exceptionally good at and there in lies the point um of adaptation. I'll give you an example. What are humans exceptionally good at? And people who exemplify this are leaders. Humans are exceptionally good at taking decisions in an indecisive environment. Leaders are exceptionally good at taking decisions in an indecisive environment and sticking with it and be, you know, being held accountable. If hits the fan, it's always the leaders who stand behind the decisions that they took. Now, you bring this back to the realm of AI. AI is, you know, it's a predictive machine that does a set of things, but humans are exceptionally good at taking decisions. And that's just one example, right? My my colleague Karthik and I were talking about this culture. Humans are exceptionally good at developing culture at permeating culture in an organization. The first two you hire become the next four could become the next eight. So if you're a startup, the leader sets the tone and the culture. So these are the things that you look at um as a human being that doubleclick on the capabilities that you bring to the table and embrace AI that comes in and and it you know serves the job of a of a co-pilot at best. So, will AI take away jobs? Yes, it will. It will take away tasks. The goal for you is to figure out what is the one task that you're good at. Double down, double click it and perhaps build more on top of it. So, that's one part of it. The second part is a little more Indiacentric if you will. Um, and I think there are two points that India is exceptionally good at which the west has which the west cannot offer and has not let the way in. The first is India's capability on digital public infrastructure. Um, you know, if you look at UPI today, we transact about uh $10 billion a day, right? If you skim 1% on top of that, that's that's about $10 million that goes away to a Mastercard or a Visa or an American Express. India is the only country that said no to corporate capitalism and said we will now create digital public infrastructure where consumers can transact within merchants and between themselves. Nobody makes money. >> So let's bring it closer to to AI and education. We have educators here. What message would this DPI or India's unique role in the global governance part? I I'm not sure whether that would interest the audience as much as your take on what educators can take away from you. >> The the role that academia plays in trying to take away the asymmetry that AI has done is going to be the ethics of AI. You cannot expect corporates to build ethics around AI. Corporates and venture capital case in point me. We are here to appease shareholders and shareholders only. Right? There exists four companies in the world who make all the money from democratized data. >> Educators have shareholders as well. So let's not get there. What is it that will actually give educational institutions more sustenance? One we heard the professor here. >> I think the multimodal approach, right? If you're going to be an educational institution, you have to think of the modes that that create an organization, right? If you take an MBA course or a BBA course, there are multiple SKs that go into creating the realm of an organization creation. Corporates are not going to do it. Governments are all playing reactive reactive role. So the role of academia is to look at how AI can be used in the realm of other courses that are non-technical in nature that goes towards building a venture um or or or building a career. Right? That's that's the role that academia has played and should continue to play. The second part I think is community. Um you know why would somebody go to university today? It's not just to learn, right? It's to build community. It's to have social interactions. I don't think that can get taken away. And I think those are the two key takeaways that universities and academia bring to the table. >> Okay. Good. So Pawan, you've been hearing very patiently and thank you for that. Uh tell us uh who is playing catchup with who? the law with AI or AI with law. >> Both of them are in their own independent silos, not wanting to talk to each other without realizing that they are all in the same boat. They will either swim or they will drown together. Bottom line is there are four things that I'm seeing which are immediate. Number one, lack of any accountability of AI. Today AI is not accountable. today you use any of these AI versions there's no s sense of uh transparency or an explanability or an accountability of any kind whatsoever the law needs to come up in that regard in January I've released the AI accountability uh framework which is collating all the legal principles and doctrines which need to be kept in mind by lawmakers as they come up with laws on accountable AI education requires 100% accountability in AI you cannot deal with the future of youngsters by having an irresponsible blackbox AI who says I don't know and I will not tell you how I come to a conclusion. That's one. Number two, I believe that AI has begun to start causing harm to humans and a big harm is being caused in the education sector in the students sector and nobody's talking about it. I've recently launched the global AI harms registry where we are saying AI is beginning to cause you nine different categories of harms. come and report anonymously or otherwise and let us know what these empirical evidence is so that we can come up with legal principles in that regard. So harm is coming in. The question is how do we mitigate those harms? Again the law and the legal frameworks will have to come in and it'll have to emanate from the government. Do not expect self-regulation to come up with any kind of accountability because that train has already left the platform. So that's the second issue that I wanted to flag. The third bigger issue is well at the end of the day this AI has started converting and is already transforming big chunk of Indian students into cognitive slaves. Indians have started walking towards cognitive colonialism which means that we are ready to be cognitive slaves of big tech companies without any accountability and it's time for the government to try to protect the cognitive thinking capabilities and the neuroites of citizens at large and definitely of student population because now with everything on an AI or a chat GPD your cognitive faculties are just not functioning and if they're not functioning you are rusting which means that you'll be irrelevant and redundant in the next few years. >> Students here, do you agree you are cognitive slaves already? Anyone wants to raise their hands? Get this lawyer in trouble. Come on. >> You think you're a cognitive slave? >> Claps for honesty, I say. [applause] >> Okay. So, your fourth point >> and my fourth fourth important point is the intellectual property rights issues will have to be dealt with very quickly. Today, everybody is generating everything through AI. Look at the terms and conditions. uh the terms and conditions tell tell you whatever you generate with your prompt command is your intellectual property rights which means you are the owner of copyright it's a very convenient way for the AIS to say guys I don't want to take legal liability you are responsible you will be legally liable for what you generate but then that's a bigger question uh today I generate my original article and just for copying or shall I say for justification purposes or grammar spell check I run it through AI it goes into the AI ecosystem database is and lo and behold my original work is gone forever because the system will always say that this is now AI generated and not generated by me. So at a time when things are not very very clear, one thing is very clear. Recently a US judge has said when an LLM is using a copyrighted work for training its data set uh training its LLMs, then that's not fair use. Which means that the law is purely going in the direction of protection of intellectual property rights. But I think we require dedicated legal frameworks. We require appropriate clarity. We also require appropriate fair use for the purposes of academic and research which today is not yet uh known. Also, since you are in the academic sector, you're all using uh education versions of AI. Do you ever realize where your data is ultimately going? Ultimately, are we not becoming guinea pigs at the laboratories or big tech companies where our data is being thrown out at massive discounts? A 3909 rupees package today actually entails that world-class services come to you for 1 month, 30 days. What you do not see is that for next 30 days you are promised to give them unfiltered complete original content of yours for them to train for the rest of your lives. I think we require utmost clarity in these four elements as we move forward. >> Okay. So cognitive uh whatever guinea pigs and slaves and these are provocative notions. uh before you put the mic and take it back and tell us what is the level of literacy among lawyers and uh judges you meet on AI before you talk about them legislating on it. >> Well, uh the level of literacy is relatively very very low to say the least. >> Give us a number >> 0001% could be a good starting point to tell you of the number of lawyers who are at least sensitized to the legal issues. Yes, everybody's becoming a user and now lawyers have become so much habituated with AI. They are drafting petitions, SLPs. Day before yesterday, the Supreme Court actually complained uh the chief justice and two other judges complaining that lawyers are now using AI for generating SLPs for generating fake uh citations of cases that don't exist. And more significantly, lawyers have started using AI on the go on the fast. The judge is asking you question, they're saying, "My lord, hold on." They go to AI. They also have now tools where the AI is saying okay hold on give this answer there's another product in town which is to say just put that on your ear here ear and it's listening live to what the judge is saying so whatever query the judge says it's telling you in your ears this is the answer you have to give and you give that so obviously it's >> full marks full marks for honesty but it's also true that lawyers must be saying the same thing for the other side I think we we shudder for that day uh we haven't had the the the professor and the academic here weigh for too long now. So we have all of 23 minutes with three or four minutes which we've stolen because of a photograph. So, so, >> so Ro, so I just wanted to talk a little bit about opportunities, right? Because we've been talking a lot about the dark side, so to say, the dark side of AI, the Darth Vader of a artificial intelligence, but there is an opportunity uh for everyone, but in particular the students who are pretty much at the cutting edge of what is happening at this point. Dario Amadoi who is the CEO of um Anthropic Claude you know the LLM that most of us use or many of us are using he came out last year to say I come from a family of venture capitalists my daughter is a venture capitalist my son-in-law is a VC as well so Jay right and I hear this a lot from them he came out last year he stated that in 2026 there is a high likelihood of a oneperson 1 billion dollar company and that was something which was impossible to even imagine a couple of years back and this is largely because of artificial intelligence uh cursor.ai AI some of you who are into coding and vibe coding in particular uh I think it is worth at this point correct me if I'm wrong Jay around $400 million and the revenue per employee is upwards of $5 million between five and 10 McKenzie on the other hand right would be somewhere around 400 300 to 400 so you can see it's already 10 times or 15 times Right. So that is one of the biggest opportunities that you have that hey you know one of you here might become a billionaire and that's what I tell my students that if you do become a billionaire you have to buy me a Porsche. All right. So that's the so that's one part. The opportunities are humongous but how you use artificial intelligence to your advantage is dependent on you. You know you can listen to us. There are like multitudes of problems that all of us can go into right but the opportunities are infinite. So please make sure this is the best time to be a student right because it's the democratization of knowledge for many centuries the way that all of us have been earning a living is through knowledge the fact that I know something that Ro doesn't that he knows something I don't and therefore I'm willing to pay him a lawyer a doctor or whoever that knowledge is now being democratized. So use it to your advantage and make sure given all the things that you were talking about the digital infrastructure that we have in this country please make sure to leverage that to become that one person billion dollar even if it's a one bit one one person billion dollar company I think that would be pretty good for us >> so pardon my journalistic uh play of words but one person with one billion is pretty nice we all want to believe that we'll be one of them so far All of us have failed on that though. Uh but having said that there'll be 1 billion people with $1 left. There could be also that that wave. So we not we shouldn't be seduced by the notions of uh greed alone but also realism. What are the skills professor Saburval that educators here need to take away from this room? You told us about the pedagogical interruption or interjection or disruption you're doing across faculties. Anything else you wish to share and be kind? Tell them. I think the biggest skill is you need to unlearn and relearn because you keep unlearning what you learned and what you survived on till today and you have to relearn the new technology and mind you just adding to what the professor said India has a great uh demographic dividend also for these model to develop and give you opportunities. There is no other country in the world like India because these models are data hungry and we have the most diverse population in this country. We have the most diverse demographics in this country. So any model LLM or frugal LLM you want to develop any application this is a country that and that is the reason they giving you free or for 3.99 or 299 or whatever because they want these models to be developed but uh from this population is the most diverse that is why students have the maximum opportunity and as he said the educators you need to you know unlearn and you have to relearn and adapt because adaptability and relearnability these are the I think the two mantras that I can give you. >> Good. So we have been given all of five minutes for audience interaction which is quite a lot actually but I'm going to be you know aware that there are queries and thoughts and uh push backs that some of you smart folks have for the lawyer the the the the VC and the bestselling author and the professor at that and of course the computer science uh jock. So if any one of you has compelling questions, this is the time to at least mark your thing in my in my radar so that I can I can go back to you and you leave with greater satisfaction because one thing I learned from uh some of the classes uh recently I took to try and unlearn and unlearn and all of that is that we only remember one thing which is what we have said. So anything that they have said you might forget what you say here you might remember. So, so go with something that's still fresh in your memory by saying it. So, any show of hands very welcome otherwise we we will go go round and round to entertain you. Okay. One, two, three. Yes. >> Fantastic. So, that means we need more than 5 minutes for Okay, good. So, please launch into a full-blown account of yourselves on the sidelines. This is the time to go specific on the question to the person. So name the person and your question. We'll really appreciate absence of comment. >> Thank you sir. I am Deep from Bhubnes Sika Anu Sandan University. My question is to professor Ais. Uh sir as you know my question is regarding education. So how do we make sure that AI technologies in schools and universities keep student data safe and private? Uh so that one data breach doesn't break all the trust people have in AI. Done. So we going to rotate questions so that you remember uh you know what everyone has said outside of just the panel. So Ashish by just stay back. Uh there were other hands this side and this side. We'll bunch like three or four questions and then uh maybe have a synergistic view. Got it sir. Thank you. From what is I saw another hand right here second row behind. Yeah. Okay. >> Yeah. Hello sir. Good evening. I'm Vijay Kumar. uh sir like uh now India is planning to like >> who are you directing the question it will really help I'm I'm faculty sir I'm faculty from >> professor sir professor sabal siral sir >> yeah so like India has got many number of IITs and many education institutions like just now you told if the faculty is not updated then there is a misbalance between student and the faculty like uh like can't we conduct some FDP faculty development ment programs because now as the A is present the student can be more prominent in the technology if the faculty doesn't get updated so is there any possibility to conduct FDPS from different universities based on the areas so that that will be easy to to coordinate >> ILM [laughter] >> [applause] >> Good evening. I am Dr. Himmanu Sharma from ILM University. Uh I have a question from Dr. Pawand Dougal. Uh I want to ask if any person sitting in America makes a cyber crime with a person sitting in uh India and uses the server placed in the Europe. So is there any international regulation on that? How to find such kind of cyber hackers? So what Indian government is doing for that? >> Got it. Good. Thank you. That was a that opens the game. >> Hello sir. My question to professor Ashish. I'm Dr. AK Jan a material science person. During my PhD time 2000 there was a problem of millennium bug. Okay just everything will destroy people are wor worried about that thing that's gone away. Then there is an era come from nanotechnology where I did my research also. Then people say that this will be lot of harming to the people and all I will come then settle down. So my question is that whether AI again is a big bubble for the market or something going on there. >> Clearly you are not paying attention. I think despite that if you think AI is a bubble wonderful I need more people like this in the room. I don't understand AI one bit. Okay. Any others? Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm Vikran Giri from ILM program. So uh I have a question from student side. So there are two kind of students. One from technical background and others from management background. I would like to ask uh uh this question from Jagrishnan sir or any other panel member can answer that what is the skill set difference industry uh look for in a student is having management background or technical background. >> Good. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. This side is completely you know left of aisle. What is going on? Last chance then we we go to our speakers because all of them have one question each already. >> Yes sir. >> Good evening sir. Myself Dr. Lumar Singh from IL program. So my very simple question can AI tools enhance the student engagement uh and outcomes or something else? There are different uh tools AI tools available. So how can it really it enhancing the student skills or or outcomes? >> Faculty. Yes. >> Students my question from panelist. >> Thank you. >> Any others? That's it. Okay. So we we close shop for a minute uh for several minutes now. Uh we start with you professor. So he asked me about FDP. Yes, we we are conducting FDPS regularly. So you be in touch, keep checking our website. We'll give you a lot of opportunities because this is I said this is important and if I am saying for my university, it applies to every university in India. And and forget about what the IITs are doing because one thing AI is doing, it's a level playing field now. It's a level playing field for both the students and the faculty because what AI is doing is democratization now of technology. So there just wait for few more time there will not be too much difference. The gap will is reducing every day. So so keep following our ILM website. >> Okay. U this site Jay you had this question on uh what entrepreneurs are wanting to hear from you. You haven't still said what it will take to get your money. >> Yeah. So, in fact, the answer to the question is a is a great quote by Mark Anderson who's one of the greatest venture capitalist, right? He said the indication of the graduating class of a university is a is a good uh pointer to what is going to happen in the market. So, if the number of graduates in the uh in the realm of management MBA is going to go up, there's probably a a bubble looming. Whereas if the number of technical graduates is going to go up, then you're going to have hypervaluations. And I think that's spot on, right? But the answer to your question, it depends on what you want to do, right? If you are looking to build a venture and you want to appeal to people like me or other venture capitalists, be obsessed with the problem, right? And potentially if you're a technologist, you're going to build a technical solution to solve that problem. So it doesn't really matter if you come from the management side or the technology side, but if you want to be building a venture, be obsessed with the problem, not with the solution. Don't be the hammer looking for a nail. Um, on the other hand, if you're looking for, you know, a job that's not to be an entrepreneur, then you double down on the degree that you have earned, right? That that would be my answer. >> Could you say this again? This is very important. The part about the entrepreneur obsessing with whatever >> problem >> hammer and tongs. No, hammer and nail. >> Hammer and the nail. Yeah. [laughter] >> So most entrepreneurs and and significantly a lot of entrepreneurs fail because they build a venture which produces a solution that the market does not want. Right? The true entrepreneurs who are really successful are obsessed not with the solution but with the problem. If you're obsessed with the problem, you'll build a solution, does not work, build a solution again, does not work. Build a solution, somebody does a pilot, build a solution, somebody will pay for it, and then you scale at some point, right? So, you have to be obsessed, really obsessed with the problem. Um, to be a very successful entrepreneur, don't be the hammer looking for a nail. Meaning, don't >> you should live long enough to tell the tale, right? >> Yeah. >> You can't you can't go bust either. Correct. you don't run out of cash as they taught me in business school. Okay. Uh Pawan sir, you are the most controversial amongst the panel. So tell us something which gets into gets you into trouble. What gets me into trouble is the fact what I speak uh looks controversial now but will be relevant tomorrow. So your question uh is there any international legal framework? There's none. There's a Buddhapest convention or the convention on cyber crime of council of Europe. India is not a signary. So if your servers are in India, you get hacked and or you are the victim in India. There's no remedy there. Good news, the United Nations has now come up with a new convention, ICT convention to prevent the misuse of ICT for criminal or illegal purposes. Came up for accession beginning October 2025. India has a very strong vort. But even that does not deal much with AI uh kind of crimes. Today almost all cyber crimes are colored with or powered with AI. So we'll have to look at a legal framework at an international level so that there should be common minimum denominators of principles that are agreed. Unfortunately that's not happening. 2015 while addressing the United Nations I said the world required an international convention on cyber law and cyber security. IDEA was too ahead of its times. Nobody bit the bullet. 2026 now they're beginning to look at ratification of the ICT convention. But now that's history. Today what you require is a global standard for AI crimes and its regulation. But that's not happening. Why? Because uh America is saying sorry I want no regulation. I want market forces to prevail. Here is India. Prime Minister Modi saying yesterday well we'll have to have a graded approach towards regulating AI. You have countries like China a top- down approach on regulating AI. You other countries like Japan a more balanced kind of an approach. So I think we'll have to look at some international frameworks so that uh at the end of the day AI is an existential threat to humanity. The quicker we start realizing it the better it is. Already AI has begun to actually stop obeying human command. It's begun to start being rogue and we have been failing till now so far to come up in place appropriate policy and legal safeguards guard rails at the building process. And now with AGI coming in by the end of the year in two years time super intelligence coming in which will supersede the cumulative intelligence of humanity as a race. I think the fundamental issues are well very clear. We are all becoming redundant. The important issues how can we still have human in the loop? How can we still have the human control and how can we still ensure that AI crimes can be minimized? Because why today the normal concepts of actors and mensria are not applicable. your intention or an action were supposed to be meant for humans. Now it's machines and algorithms which are creating or which are doing criminal activity. The other day at one of the conferences I met somebody who said I'm in the enterprise business. When I said what? He said cyber crime enterprise business. And I was surprised. I said you are doing cyber crime prevention. He says no we are committing cyber crime and we using >> teasing you. He must be teasing you. Come on. >> No no he's not teasing me. >> Don't don't don't scare everybody. this is a nice evening and we're kind of whatever but anyhow professor we [clears throat] were woefully off topic you know we were we we'll be given our dinner based on whether we say building future ready learners and institutions so help us synergize some of these ideas from your vantage point and tell us what are the future learners and institutions going to look like so that those who are learners and those who are institution uh you know faculty take something away from this this very rich and diverse uh discussion which we're very grateful for. >> I I kind of I'll try my level best to do that because there was a lot of stuff um that we uh discussed here. I think to me u Jay's um what he highlighted was the importance of understanding problems and um you know spending 90% of your time trying to understand the problems rather than trying to come up with a solution whether it's a technical solution usually it's always a technical solution the excitement around AI is that the technical solutions [snorts] um can be to a certain degree or to a large extent outsourced to AI What cannot be outsourced is understanding the problem and that's the role that the humanities and management uh students will play a lot or or professionals will play a lot right and that that's why it becomes even more so important as a matter as an example design thinking you know Stanford D school design thinking course is considered to be to provide one of the most transformative experiences of all the courses particularly in the exact that space because of this reason that they one of the first things that they emphasize on is the important of human beings and the human interactions. So, so from that standpoint, you know, when we think about curriculum in the future, it won't be computing science. So, the faculties just can't exist anymore. It has to be multiddisiplinary. It has to be where all these different faculties come together, right? We exist in tribes. We we just love our tribe and whether it is to do with a school within a faculty or a faculty within a university but that ain't going to work in the future you know so multi-disiplinarity is going to become really important understanding the problems from different stakeholders and how they approach it same as with curriculum you know one of the things that uh a lot of u you know from a pedagogical standpoint AI is being used for transformative learning experience And transformative learning experience would be that it's through experience that you realize that the mental models that you have made up is there's there are flaws to it and how that and then in in in some ways it's it's uh through reflection that you realize that. So the curriculum is going to change. The way the universities have to be organized has to change. The uh we have to look for synergies rather than existing as tribes. And uh we have to work together and that's no mean feat for any university believe it or not because the first thing that we do is that we worry about what is in it for me my department my school rather than the good of you know the faculty and this and primarily the students and and stakeholders. So so that to me is the first one. Second one is um the how you can use you know we have a movement AI for good where particularly for the global south that we are using really um very so to say inexpensive cheap cheap solutions for very complex problems and we can do it at scale again that was not something that we could do before. So the social aspect of you know there are all these existential risks there is the I got a question about privacy I mean there are no doubt about it that that's going to be the big thing in the future and if you look at Apple one of the reasons someone asked me why Apple is still doing performing so well is because uh privacy is embedded in their design right and and we I kind of know that when I use Apple it protects me from that so so you know so those would be to me some of the things in the future that what what universities have to do. Are we there? Not really. But if we are not then we certainly have an existential risk and that is for the faculty you know our computing science faculty has to learn a lot about management management faculty has to learn about the technical side of it doesn't mean that I'm going to be expert because you know the democratization of knowledge has already happened. >> So yeah that would be some things. >> So thank you uh thank you. uh in one word one advice that you would like to leave the audience with I'll go like this paw sir one word advice be aware and be cyber resilient be topical in this world when AI is beginning to make you redundant >> this was a long word I said thank you for that yeah >> yeah I just want to take a very philosophical view this two shall pass >> after saying all that he did. He says this too shall pass and Pawandul says you are like whatever he said guinea pigs and what have you. So we have a small difference of opinion. Okay. >> Two words uh resilience and adaptability. >> You stole that word from professor Saburwal. He said adaptability. Okay. So there you go sir. So uh I think for the faculty I have years down the line we will become rather than professors facilitators because I think these universities will be places for socializing because most of the content we are teaching today will be taught through ARVR headsets. >> Thank you guys. Thank you very much. Okay. [applause] Thank you. >> Thank you sir. Thank you so much for Thank you so much for such insightful discussion. Today's discussion made one thing clear. AI is not replacing humans but it is redefining what it means to be valuable. AI can take over routine task and boost productivity but outsourcing thinking to machine risk weakening critical judgment. The real shift must happen in education. teaching students how to learn with AI not fear with it. While AI will automate task, human remains uniquely strong in decision making under uncertainity, accountability and culture building. This is where leadership and ethics matter. India's strong digital public infrastructure given us a unique opportunity but academia must lead by embedding AI ethics, interdicciplinary learning and responsible use. This is what our speakers have told us today. So we are going with lot of takeaway and we faculty have lot of work to do back home. Thank you so much for joining us today. >> Full marks full marks to notebook LM you know notebook. [applause] >> Thank you so much. So I would request Dr. Manish Saburval to facilitate uh felicitate our guest. Sorry Dr. Ash [applause] they want to take [laughter] >> Mr. Rohit Bansi [applause] >> I request uh Dr. Shamik Tari to felicitate Mr. Pawan Dougal [applause] I request Dr. Shabikari to felicitate Mr. Sh. [applause] >> Thank you so much for this wonderful evening. We have frame photo frames for the today's evening. I request Dr. Sati to kindly provide those frames. So please you can open that and it will be a good way to >> [applause] >> New York. [applause] >> Yes. Yes. Yes. >> [applause] >> really
