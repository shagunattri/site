I’m writing this as a living note.

Not a growth hack thread.
Not “10 tips to go viral.”
But a clear mental model of **how X (Twitter) actually decides who wins** in 2025 — especially if you’re building in **AI, cybersecurity, startups, or DevSecOps**.

My personal targets are aggressive:

* **500 verified followers**
* **3M impressions**
* **3 months**
* **No paid growth, no engagement bait**

So I went deep into the open-source X algorithm, creator data from 2024–25, and real-world testing.

This post is the result.

## First: Stop Thinking in “Tweets”

X does **not** rank “tweets”.

It ranks **behavior**.

Every post you make is judged by one question:

> *“What will a real human likely do after seeing this?”*

Not:

* How many followers you have
* How often you post
* How clever the wording is

But whether someone will:

* Pause
* Read
* Save
* Reply
* Come back

That’s the game.

## How the X Algorithm Works (Plain English)

The timeline is built in stages:

### 1. Candidate Generation

X pulls in:

* Tweets from people you follow
* Tweets from people you *don’t* follow
* Tweets from trending topics and interest graphs

Important:

> About **half of your feed comes from accounts you don’t follow**

This is why small accounts can explode.

### 2. Scoring (The Real Battle)

Each tweet is scored using machine learning models that predict:

* Will you **reply**?
* Will you **bookmark**?
* Will you **spend time reading**?
* Will you **engage again later**?

Not all engagement is equal.

Which brings us to the most important section.

## The Signals That Matter Most in 2025

Here’s the real hierarchy:

### 1. Replies (Especially Thoughtful Ones)

Replies are the strongest signal.

* Long replies
* Back-and-forth discussions
* Disagreement done respectfully

If your post starts conversations, X pushes it hard.

### 2. Bookmarks (The Silent Superpower)

Bookmarks are criminally underrated.

If someone saves your post, X assumes:

> “This content has long-term value.”

Save-worthy content travels far.

### 3. Time Spent (Dwell Time)

If someone stops scrolling to read your post, that’s gold.

This is why **threads dominate**.

### 4. Likes & Retweets

Still useful.
Just weaker than replies and saves.

### 5. Account Credibility

Verification helps.
Activity helps more.

A small active account beats a large inactive one every time.

## Threads vs Long Posts: What Actually Works?

### Short answer:

* **Threads = reach**
* **Long posts = authority**

### Why threads win the algorithm

Threads:

* Increase time spent
* Create multiple ranking surfaces
* Encourage replies
* Encourage saves

Each tweet in a thread is another chance to appear in feeds.

**Ideal thread length:**
👉 **3–6 tweets**

Long enough to teach.
Short enough to finish.

### What about long posts / X Articles?

X *does* reward long-form content **if it stays on X**.

Key rule:

> External links hurt reach. Native content wins.

Long posts work best when:

* Explaining complex topics (AI, AppSec, architecture)
* You want depth over virality

**Best strategy:**

* Thread to hook attention
* Long post to deliver depth

## How You Should Post on X in 2025

Here’s the practical playbook.

### 1. Write to Be Saved, Not Liked

Ask yourself:

> “Would I bookmark this?”

If the answer is no, rewrite it.

Examples that work:

* Checklists
* Frameworks
* Lessons learned
* Diagrams
* Mistakes & insights

### 2. Use Threads for Education

Especially in:

* AI
* Cybersecurity
* SAST / AppSec
* Startups

Threads let you:

* Teach progressively
* Hold attention
* Invite discussion

End with:

* A summary
* A question
* A challenge

### 3. Stay On-Platform

X wants people to stay on X.

Avoid:

* Link-only posts
* “Read more here” content

If you must link out:

* Put it in a reply

### 4. Engage Like a Human

Posting alone won’t grow you.

Growth comes from:

* Replying to others
* Adding real value
* Disagreeing thoughtfully
* Quoting posts with insight

Every good reply is:

* Content
* Distribution
* Networking

### 5. Use Hashtags Sparingly but Precisely

Hashtags help X understand **context**.

For my niche:

* `#AI`
* `#CyberSecurity`
* `#AppSec`
* `#SAST`
* `#DevSecOps`
* `#Startups`

1–3 is enough.

## What the Algorithm Punishes

Avoid these if you care about reach:

* Posting many standalone tweets in a row
* Engagement bait
* Repetitive content
* Low-effort AI spam
* External links everywhere

X filters aggressively now.

## My Current Posting Strategy

This is what I’m running with:

* **3–4 high-quality threads per week**
* **1 long-form post per week**
* Daily thoughtful replies in my niche
* Visuals wherever possible
* Tracking:

  * Impressions
  * Replies
  * Bookmark rate

If something doesn’t get saved, I iterate.

## Final Mental Model

Think of X as:

> **A public thinking engine, not a marketing channel**

The algorithm rewards:

* Clarity
* Depth
* Conversation
* Consistency
* Staying on-platform

Threads work because they align with how humans learn.

If you treat X like a notebook instead of a billboard, growth follows.
