Free Trials for end users are a great way to experience the platform and extract the most value out of it while you have the time, which is a natural behavior for us humans.

But on the other end are teams deciding whether to have a trial in the first place or a free Plan maybe a freemium plan for their product.

Free Trials as a rule of thumb should only be introduced when your product/offering is 
- mature
- out of MVP/PMF stage
- has a considerable value that can make the customers pay for it.

Within PM, it is essential to look at the problem from different perspectives and zoom out to focus on the bigger picture.

In choosing an optimal free trial one length has to look at:
- Existing product business model
- the value it can generate from the trial
- data and insights on similar product categories
- positioning and messaging of your trial

A wrong trial setup will only lead you to onboard multiple users and dilute product value. It is important to find the right balance of business requirements, timings, product USP and pricing structure with all other details involved to make for the best Trial experience.

The following covers research from various products that have introduced different free trial models and their details.

## [#2 finding the right people](https://nicoles.substack.com/p/finding-the-right-people)

Having the right group of people around you can turn things around and help bring the best out of both. The games we play in our head and the little actions we take to get in touch with people allow us to bring in the butterfly effect and turn tides.

But how do you find the right people? Simple answer - "Fuck around and Find Out". It takes a lifetime to find the right people and the right one eventually. The only way is to explore, meet and interact.

> Don‚Äôt surround yourself with ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù people. The trick is to surround yourself with people who are free in ways you‚Äôre not.

The definition of smarter is different for everyone, finding people who don't have the same background as yours is a good start. There is no one-size-fits-all here, some tend to discuss work and need people with similar backgrounds while some collate insights from people with other backgrounds and build a tribe of people they hang out with.
