advantage the talent creators. We are on a very bold mission to reinvent how individuals learn in an AI disrupted world to empower institutions for an AIdriven future and to transform enterprises for the age of intelligence. The AI economy will not be powered by technology or by talent alone. We all know that it will be both. The air economy is very important. With that, we have decided to host two panel discussions for this interesting evening of today. And I'm really really glad for all of you to have joined us today. The first discussion will be a very important and a very rewarding discussion topic about powering institutions for a AIdriven future. And for that discussion, let me take the privilege of inviting the moderator Deepika Kapoor. Deepika leads industry partnerships and outreach at ITI it sector skill council NASCOM where she drives large-scale collaborations with industry academia government to build sustainable skilling ecosystems with close to 20 years of experience spanning marketing community building and program strategy. She's played a key role in shaping national level skilling initiatives and aligning industry needs with workforce readiness. Her work focuses on creating measurable impact at scale through partnerships and innovations. Welcome Deepika. We're very happy to have you here today. Let me now take the privilege of inviting the panelist professor Aloc Kumar Ry. Professor Alokumaray is a distinguished academician, administrator and a management pioneer currently serving as the director of Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata since July 30, 2025. Before joining IM Kolkata, Professor Rice served as the vice chancellor of the University of Lucknau for two consecutive terms from 2019 to 2025 during which the university achieved unprecedented academic milestones. He has completed three major research projects funded by UGC and AICT, supervised nine doctoral dissertations and holds five IPRs in the area of relationship management. He's also a reviewer and editorial board member of top tier journals published by Eliver Sage and Inersonense. Professor Ry has authored seven books, edited five and published over 75 research papers in index journals alongside numerous book chapters and popular writings in major media platforms such as Times of India, Outlook, Firstport and Business Line. Professor Ry continues to expire excellence as he leads IM Calcq with his unique approach of five I's inclusion innovation internalization and Indianness building upon its rich legacy and positioning it as a global leader in management education. Can we have a round of applause for professor Ray? Thank you so much. The next panelist let me have the pleasure and privilege of inviting Anurag Bansil. Anurag Bansil is the managing director of Accenture Learn Vantage India where he leads strategy growth across Accenture's learning and skilling ecosystem in India helping organizations and institutions reimagine and reinvent how they create future ready talent and the scale of age of AI. Previously as chief executive officer of talentsprint which is now a part of Accenture. He provided visionary leadership in scaling the businesses deepening industry academia collaboration and launching skills first approach high impact programs such as national AI olympiad and AI infinitity that are preparing talent for real world roles in the age of intelligence with over two decades of leadership experience across organizations including huge global network. Ashok Cleland, Mahindra and Mahindra and career launcher. Anurog brings a distinctive perspective on AIEL talent transformation and enterprise capability building through leadership management development for an AI disrupted world. Thank you Anurag. Let me now also have the privilege of inviting the next panelist Abino Benerjee. Abin Benji heads the education and skills charter for AWS India. He's been a part of the industry for close to two decades in a driving technology based transformation. Creating an AI ready workforce is central to Vix Bharat aspiration and requires deep collaboration across industry with government, academia and partners at AWS. He's been building the ecosystem to drive education and skilling initiatives at scale from ground up. His vision is central to our nation's AI promise and for AWS to serve as the skilling backbone of India's AI powered Wixit bat future. With such esteemed panelist members, I'm really really excited for the discussion and I hope you all have the same. We look forward to that and now I request Zipika to take that over. Thank you so much. >> Hi, thank thanks so much. Good afternoon everyone. uh welcome to this session and uh thank you for walking all those couple of thousand steps to reach here and join us for the session. So uh we'll quickly quick start here. Uh we are at a moment where the world of work is changing faster than the traditional education model. AI is no longer a future concept. It's already shaping how decisions are made, product are built and the value is created. the interactions even we have today with the universities and the colleges. I mean we've been hearing that a big point of discussion and a pressing question is that how the education should keep pace with the changing technology needs which AI is bringing to the forefront and while we already have the uh Indian education policy kicked in right uh and thanks to the changes that the government has brought into this entire ecosystem still I think there is a pressing need of matching the speed of the technology and also in terms of how do the skill set uh becomes the core scope of learning and the shift happens where the uh traditional degree based centric education is getting the skill-based learning into the ecosystem. So with that I would uh like to initiate the discussion and uh ask professor Aloc here that what as per you is the single most urgent change AI is forcing on institutions today. Uh is it curriculum? Is it pedagogy? Is it assessments or is it the fac faculty capabilities? You know before speaking directly onto the question asked if I may say that especially the kind of ecosystem that has been created all across the country it tries to convey me message as if everything is going to change because of AI. How I see artificial intelligence is an extension of information technology tool that is there to support our decision making. Support by making it faster I mean speedier, more accurate. And how does this actually work? This works on available data, data that is available in the internet space and uses certain algorithms to project based on past performances. Right? So it projects your decision making as if what can be done say for example I was coming going eating reading it it could have been anything so my mobile says coming to AI summit so it will give you few options based on your previous pattern it'll project some probables you got to select one right the most simple thing So let us not treat artificial intelligence as a god as a replacement of god which is there for everything. It is an information technology tool nothing more nothing less designed to support our decision making process speedier and relatively more accurate. Now in an educational institution I see the greatest impact. But before coming out of that also let us have a clear conception as to how do we see India Indian an Indian institution and an Indian teacher and head of an Indian educational institution. How do I see artificial intelligence as an information technology tool that I say is an extension of prevailing information technology tools is that we still are talking largely of the benefits of AI and when we talk of benefits of AI we talk of its consumption. I believe the time has come when we have got to start thinking of artificial intelligence revolution not just from creation consumption point of view but also from creation point of view because I believe we did very well and it was much talked about thing during IT revolution initial when when computerization and subsequent digitization world started taking place we missed the us by merely providing coders to the world. We hardly have had IT products and I say that honorable prime minister has very rightly touched the quad where he said that we should try and come up with artificial intelligence products also not just some I mean back office service providers. So let us move beyond consumption. When I'll reply to the specific question that was asked, I would want to reply beyond a consumer, I mean as an educational institution, I can consume artificial intelligence in delivery, in pedagogy, in evaluation, very importantly in governance. I'll share couple of examples also. But having said this, why did I say all this is because as an institution, as a responsible institution of the country, as head of that institution, it's my duty to also think of institutional contribution in terms of creation of artificial intelligence knowledge and not just use it for a consumption like for example in our evaluation before that I was vice vice chancellor of a big university which has had close to five lakh students on campus off campus. Now five lakh student in a semester appears in six papers. So in one semester we were supposed to evaluate 30 lakh copies. How will this be evaluated? You have limited number of faculty. Not all faculty are equally trained, equipped and competent. But you have got to evaluate. If you get that evaluated only by a certain teachers with certain norms, it will take months and years. And if it is not seriously evaluated, the day result is out 500 students will be standing making all the narazi against the vice chancellor number. Now can we have a simple it's a very simple AI model that can evaluate those copies and evaluate to perfection I mean what all do you need to do is just scan those copies content map it with the with the best possible option available and project this with this. So if if say 500 words are to be there and these should be the content of those 500 words only 15% is there so you'll get 15% marks but the difficulty will be that but then that that that can subsequently be worked upon another was at IM Kolkata I try to implement it so I called one of the faculty who was an expert he so he said I'll myself develop a tool I said but evaluate it manually as well as with this tool and let us give both the options to the student because ultimately it's a student's world. We are doing it for students. So let them accept which one is is something that they want to be evaluated through and then after a terms evaluation we found out that we are going to extrapolate it to the entire term but not with one tool. Let us have three tools and let us give the option to the student as if they want to take the mean or the best of the three so that the the benefit should also always be the benefit of doubt should always go to these students. Same artificial intelligence tool can be assessed in our admissions which is very critical. Students are have got enormous complaints about I've I've been fairly evaluated or not. So let you be evaluated by individuals but also supported by some tool that again as I said previously is that it will project based on the pasts and your content that you have provided to the reservoir. Now based on this content I can always project it with certain standard algorithms which will equally be applicable to all these students. So you will have your score. So wherever subjective marking comes in let this be done by machines so that it gives the least. So in in all the functions of uh the institutional governance or institutional uh institute student relationship it can surely be infused and infused to make the life better and easier. >> Wonderful perspective. I think you've already given lot of case studies and you know cases and ideas to explore AI into the world. So next one I think in line to the same conversation Anurag this would be for you in terms of we've been talking about AIdriven economy. So but what does it really mean for the educational system? I mean professor picked up on lot of areas where AI can be used but how do we kind of see it reflecting into the uh education e ecosystem if we talk about AIdriven economy >> um when we and like professor Ry has already mentioned uh about AI. So uh everybody is talking about AI which is artificial intelligence but I think there is another AI that has to tackle that AI which is A for academia and I for industry that is also AI. So artificial intelligence has to be tackled by academia and industry together. Human as humans we don't have any d of creativity we can create anything in our minds. Correct. What has AI done? AI has removed the strains from our creativity. Today AI can make probably bahali on Mars isn't it? You can create bahali on Mars but that creativity AI will give wings. Now when it comes to academia and industry there has been a long-standing debate. We will always say okay people are not employable. There are there is a huge gap what industry requires what students are learning there is a gap we all have been students I will tell you what was initially what used to happen we all are trained in our minds to get experience on the job okay we have done engineering after doing the engineering the day you enter first day on the job. You will suddenly realize whatever theorems I have read reality is completely different. So that is the gap. It is not a gap between my understanding, my capability, but it is the gap of perception. So we have been trained to get experience on the job. With AI that is no more an option because AI will impact how the work is done. AI will impact how the workflows will happen and like professor Ry has given examples that today we can create anybody can create. It is not that you have to be an AI expert to create something out of AI. You just have to understand what exactly AI can do and then anybody can create any application from that. So it was not ever it was not about what artificial intelligence can do. It is always about how we can train our manpower, our students, our professionals on how to use AI to create something, not to use but to create something. And that is where it is very essential that in current programs there has to be industry and academia collaboration so that together industry can tell academia that exactly this is what I want or this is going to be the trend after two three years. Just imagine today we are talking about AI now we have heard Jai suddenly there is agentic AI okay so now there is a program that we start in AI it is a fouryear engineering program let us assume that we start the program with this who knows what is going to happen after four years we will start talking about after some time we will start talking about adaptive AI after four years when the person is graduating the content is graduating in AI, JAI, agentic AI, the world will be talking about quantum AI. So it is essential for this collaboration so that with each and every passing uh technology enhancement that should be passed on real time to the academia to the students that they should start learning quantum AI from year two they should start learning adaptive AI from year one. So I think that is where I see that industry academia collaboration is very important for future programs and skilling. >> Wonderful. And I think um Abhinav this one would be for you from the industry perspective. Uh again as in and uh Anurag very well mentioned that there is a lot of change which is already happening. So how do the institutes they you know reinvent themselves to stay closely aligned to this evolving industry demand. >> Sure. Thanks first of all Axenture and my fellow panelists for inviting me this panel. Um really good to be here. Thank you to the entire audience for braving all the crowds outside in fact the rains and sitting here patiently and listening to us. Thank you for that. So just coming back to your question. Um so at AWS all of all of you are probably aware of what we do right um in terms of technology our mission and vision is to democratize the access to technology and drive transformation at a citizen level not just for businesses but at a core citizen level. So our mission for AWS India is categorically about building for India and for the world from India. Right now a very key component of that is building the talent for the future. Right? The whole idea of India's AI promise today is based out of the talent we produce. We will have the compute. We will have all the GPUs in the world. We will have all the technology in the world but we need the right talent. We need to build the right capability for the future. And you mentioned a very important point Dr. Alo um that we need to move the mindset from becoming a consumption economy towards a creation economy. We have to play it very smartly folks right. Um we have all the chips in the room right we have the right set of talent in this country who can be the supplier for the future in terms of the talent required to produce that competitive edge right but at the same time we are facing this huge challenge today whenever I go and speak to our customers the main challenge they're facing is the scissors effect where the skills gap required to have the right kind of AI based productivity and outcomes produced for a customer organization is increasing at a higher rate of change as compared to the right kind of talent pool being created in India. So the recent figures I got to know from a report was that almost half of the talent coming out of universities is unemployable unemployable to the standards these organizations want given the kind of projects and deliveries they would like to have. So there's definitely a gap. Now alluding back to professor Aloc's point that AI is obviously new but the concepts are not new. We have faced technological transitions in the past as well. Yes, it's a structural change this time. So the impact and the magnitude is much more deeper. But what we really need to understand is the key aspect of change here is the rate of change. Every two and a half weeks, every two and a half weeks there's a new LLM coming out in the a new version of an LLM coming out in the market. Right? So the step change is much higher. The halflife of skills which when probably Anurag and I were growing up as you alluded to our engineering past was around 10 years today it is less than two years. So rather than looking at it as a gap in what the academia is doing I would look at it as a systems thinking required by industry and academia together. around the fact that what we have done for financial inclusion in India which is the digital public infrastructure all of you use UPI right we need a similar moment for education as well we need to have a bhat eduai stack I know some of us are building it I think it madras is building it but we need to all come together from academ to have a systems thinking to it if you have a ado collaboration announcementbased approach to this we will miss the bus on the rate of change today of course Accenture AWS IM we all have industry academy connects we all have programs which are brilliant which are going across India AWS itself has a program called academy which has skilled millions of learners and faculty with accredited universities across India and we are solving the problem of the talent pipelines into these organizations but again is this enough so we need a systems approach. We need a see the good part is that we have the right kind of agility in the government. The policy support and the government is listening. The ministry and the skills departments are listening and the industry is very well favored in terms of producing these changes. So if you all come together and we think about a systems approach on how to build that digital public infrastructure on education then get into how do we bring let's say and the mindset here is what is required for the future not today is already gone right where the puck is going to be three years down the line whether it is haptic engineering whether it is physical AI whether it is creation economy right we have to build on that because type it takes time to create pipeline. It is not built overnight. So hence I think we need a stack approach a systems approach and therein if the industry and the academia come together as a part of that stack as a part of a inclusion mission rather than an ad hoc collaboration I think that is scalable in a country like India else will be a newspaper report forgotten in 4 days. >> Thanks thanks Abinav. I think that's a great perspective and um I believe from AWS perspective we've been very closely working and there's a lot of programs which are being designed and you know taken on ground. So and to you Anuraga as well you've been spearheading this entire uh you know engagement initiatives and platforms where you're trying to bridge this uh gap between skill-based learning and the degree uh you know the model. So how do you think the future programs you know what could be the opportunity to design differently the future programs and the delivery models? I think like uh what will be the future of the programs and like professor Ry and Aina rightly said there is there will not be a single program okay there will be collaborations like for example if something new AI development happens see we cannot stop technology neither we can stop technology development It will happen. Today it is AI, tomorrow it will be something else. But take an example that okay if we take what is best in academia, what is best in technology, what is best in applications, can we create some program where our students or our generation is taught on how everything works and how I can create something out of it. So they learn the basics, they learn the creativity, they learn how to use the tools and then they learn how to deploy it. I think that is the future of education and that is I foresee futuristic program you can call where it is wholesome program not only based out of academia or based only on technology but it is amalgamation of all these three aspects of learning. Just think about it. Accenture and AWS, we keep talking. We keep working on lot of projects. Lot of programs. There is something called ACI, Amazon cloud institute programs specially developed for today's generation. We run that program. So it is a joint initiative by us. Same way we run a lot of programs uh with academia and they listen to us like professor Ry was saying we give them feedback that this should be a part of the programs and they do it. If we say that okay what are the AI models that will be there for business they create it. So I think future lies to all of us together not working in silos and just think about it. I was uh you might be hearing prompt engineering. Okay, everybody is saying I am a prompt engineer. I am learning prompt engineering. It is a fancy word. What exactly is prompt engineering? It is just going back to basics, isn't it? how you do the right prompts. Today we all I'm 100% sure many of us are using chat GPT gemini claude for gen. Okay, we will post a question we expect some answer. We will post another question we will expect some answer. Do you believe that answer is correct? How many of you believe the answer you have received is correct? It depends what exactly prompt you have given. Okay. Even if you change the prompt by one word, your answer can be completely different. Plus, because AI is learning from data, you start providing wrong data to AI, it will start giving you wrong answers. Okay? So AI also hallucinate. So who is going to check AI? Are we teaching okay are we teaching people how to check the authenticity of AI? There is a big study currently going on responsible AI. We don't want to be like in movies you would have seen AI world 5 10 years back that there are robots and we are all prisoners in those robots. Nobody wants to do that. Correct? So are we teaching responsible AI in our schools in our colleges? So I think that is where what we have to teach. We have to teach basics, creativity, economics, humanities, all these basic subjects will remain at the core. Nobody can change that. Even AI cannot change that. But what AI will change or what any technology will change is that industry, academia coming together, all parts of academia, all parts of industry coming together and creating programs that will create real professionals for the upcoming age of intelligence. That's what I see. >> No, wonderful. And um another uh viewpoint could be that you know uh with the industry certification Aina do you think I mean the certifications or the product knowledge which the industry is imparting through evaluating students on certain niche skill set. So is that an advantage and how it will it is going to you know uh bridge this employability gap? Yeah, definitely. I think um certifications of course is very very important in terms of validation of your credentials. Um every learning needs an outcome, right? And that outcome has to be benchmarked to global standards, right? As simple as that. When I said earlier the mission for AWS is creating for India and for the world from India, right? uh we can't be just creating talent also only for India right so everything we do needs to have an outcome it has to be a global benchmark like at AWS we have our AWS certifications globally benchmarked towards industries towards roles towards technology domains towards skills and so on so forth right now if you've gone through a learning pathway you have invested your time within an academia or within a you know organization and if your verifiable credentials All of you use LinkedIn today. All of you are posting your skill badges, your micro credentials, your certifications. What does it really do for you? It actually gives you a verifiable way to benchmark your knowledge. Of course, it doesn't provide you experience that has to be earned, but at the same time, it helps you create a stackable skill block being verified on a global level. So I think it's a very important positioning perspective as well that while we are creating the talent pipeline while we are creating a talent pool there should be a benchmarking activity alongside the learning to make it more stackable to make it more you know globally viable. >> Super and uh um professor you already spoke about that how AI is uh you know the use cases that you called out. So maybe we can think that the future belongs to uh maybe techno management and uh how do we see that the institutions I mean in terms of the shift that which institutions should bring in uh to design programs and to develop these graduates to face the future of work. >> If I'm allowed I would just reword techno management to application management. Management in itself is an application based discipline. But what we are doing at IM Calcata is along with our regular flagship programs which are largely academic in nature. We are on a spree of initiating three programs in three respective functional specializations at IM Kolkata in strict collaboration with industry. So we already have two programs which are run in association with different institutions. So one program is with IIT Kpur and IT Madras I am Kolkata. Another program is with ISI Kolkata, IIT Karakapur and IM Kolkata. But now we are coming up with three programs. All these individual programs are are having more than one industry partners. So that what all we teach our students during their one year or two stay in the on the campus should be more than just imparting certain knowledge. I mean specific domain knowledge but also prepare them from day one for the job. So say for example a a finance program if it has got a private equity firm on board, a fintech company on board and a regulatory financial authority is on board the application orientation and the skill strength of these student who once become professional is far more effective from day one as compared to any other professional. So similarly the programs are there. I mean industry partnership is very important. Having said this let us not digress with the core theme here which is powering institution for an AIdriven future. The way these decision makings I go back to the fundamental line that I had said artificial intelligence is an advanced information technology tool to facilitate our decision making by making it speedier and relatively more accurate. In in all these cases what is important is decision making be it finance program or a marketing program or an HR program or an IT program or manufacturing program this decision making is going to go going to be backed by these artificial intelligence tools and if these decision makings are going to be backed by artificial intelligence tool the delivery also should have this component not just be taught as a subject not just be taught just as as some sort of skill set but also it should be part of respective courses in a program. So if in a program there are number of courses these courses should have artificial intelligence be embibed as a tool so that there also they are trained to use it for decision making and that that will enable them to take their decisions faster and speedier backed by artificial intelligence. Wonderful profess and um I think the next question which I have in mind is very well sitting you know on top of what you just mentioned in the sense that to do Abhinav uh what should institutes rethink education as a continuous skill journey rather than one-time you know based credential learning. So how can skills be kind of fitted into this credentials based learning rather than you know like a degree program being done and what education institutes can do differently to inculcate this. I think I I partly answered your question in my previous reply but having said this an institute like Indian Institute of Management Kolkata our executive programs are far outnumbering a regular program in terms of number of participants. So if we have 1,500 total regular students on campus, we have 7,500 plus executive programs who are professionals and that is where we fit into the role of being a skill skill imparting or skill enhancing institution rather than mere providing this domain knowledge. Having said this, I also said that all our programs are continuously being redesigned and we are incorporating not just the latest research outcomes that are coming in the domain specific domain area but also enriching it with as it's very aptly written like AIdriven future. So where lies the future of the professionals those who are coming. So if the future of marketing is going to be like this, if the future of finance is going to be changed accordingly, we have got to change our entire curriculum imparting framework in sync with the requirement to enable them to be a successful professional and be a productive professional from day one. >> Abina, would you like to top up with your thoughts on it because you very closely work with the academy? So >> Sure. Sure. I I think it's not just incumbent upon the academies to be honest. It's uh again um the AIdriven future is together right and I tal spoke about systems thinking in uh the bas answer as well that there's a role technology organizations play here right and that is very integral to how theademies behave in terms of the future in terms of building the right kind of curriculara um in my view it is the acronym ITL um I as in the infrastructure um and when I'm talking about I'm not just talking about the premier institutions. I'm talking aboutmies across India. Right. Right down to a you know tier four, tier five city, emerging tech talent hubs and so on so forth. So infrastructure which is the access to technology is very important which is having at least the access to edge AI if not a full GPU compute right and that is where our role our role play you know is very crucial right. um unless until you have access to let's say the compute or the application stack or any other layers available to you to even learn or start learning I think the whole exercise is futile the second is t which is teachers I think there's a d of uh faculty learning programs at scale today I know we are all doing it but still when I look at the gap numbers they run into millions right so we again need to think at population scale and not just enterprise scale or not just any other u you know core joint announcements or collaborations. I think we all need to sit together and think about population scale. uh how to solve for that and one of the key components of that is also having industry aligned curriculara right like for example we were talking about certifications earlier and even though AWS will have these 12 global certifications always available to you but on a constant basis as we ourselves are evolving our own technology on a constant basis we keep updating our certifications our learning content our cur curriculum. I think a similar approach has to be taken by academies. I'm sure they're doing it as well. Like I said before, the half-life of skills has reduced to even less than two years now. I think a constant systems thinking should be in place where academy is aligned with industry. They're feeding off the industry requirements, the jobs of the future. What kind of skill matrix do they need in terms of industry and domain depth? And one thing deep I've seen missing today is that when we are thinking about population scale we think about numbers as an output metric right like you know how many people have we skilled I think the numbers have to be an input metric as to how we get to number of people >> but the output has to be what kind of outcomes did we drive did we drive an uplift in employability did we drive day one readiness where there's a 51% gap today >> did we drive a uplift in entrepreneurship. It is not just about getting jobs anymore in India. All of us all of us know that right. How do we build that mindset of entrepreneurship? How do we enable entrepreneurship through skills and enablement at scale? I think that is where a very crucial role of that ITL and the last one L is linguistics. We are all talking and conversing here in English but India is not just this one language but 22 languages. So we have to be when we are talking about AI we have to be sensitized around being indication to be enabled on AI as well right so ITL I'll keep it there I think that is where a lot of work is required >> thank you so much and I know we're at the top of the hour and I'm would I'm looking for the organizers can I have just one quick take from everybody uh the panel here 30 seconds on uh if you look ahead in 10 years What will distinguish institutions that successfully power the AIdriven future from those that fall behind? And maybe we can start from you. >> I think institutions who will accept that there is change, change is going to happen and there will be institutions who will think nothing is going to change like something else was there three years back. It will come and go. AI will come and go. and we will continue as it is. I think this thought of changing with time has come upon us and after 10 years that will distinguish between these two institutions. One will be which will be standing upon all the technologies, management, innovation, collaboration on the top of all these things and there will be another institutions that will be still doing regular degrees, regular uh frameworks, regular teaching. I will give you one example and I'm sure a lot of people may not agree with that because I have not seen people accepting it that widely. Today when I go and meet lot of institutions and we talk about online degrees okay there is a traditional degree definitely traditional degrees are there when we talk about online degrees there are many institutions which still feel that it is third third world sort of programs okay they are still not able to believe that word world is moving faster master away from traditional teaching methods. Okay. What benefits online degrees bring? Because it brings a lot of collaboration. You it gets you best of faculties. It it can get you best of industry experts. So hanging on to your legacy programs or pedagogy may not work. It requires change. Let us accept it as fast as possible because after 10 years with each passing year this gap will keep increasing and we will be staring at two completely different type of institutions standing before us. That's what I feel. Professor your take. >> Only [clears throat] those institutions will sustain successfully who will keep evolving with the change that takes place with passage of time. So time testing institution essentially need to keep evolving with the change of the market and that is what we are trying to strive for. Abina. >> Yeah, I know I have to be quick. Uh, very quickly, I think adaptability to change will be a key differentiator overall. Uh, but also I think themies not just from a curricular perspective or from a student outreach perspective but I thinkademies or a university of the future would be the one which adapts AI for their own operations and you know workings as well. Right. So I think in India there's a particular gap of staffing challenges as well and most of our you know faculty is usually engaged in undifferiated heavy lifting right so we have to take away all that taskbased approach and replace it with AI augment it and have the faculty deliver some higher outcomes thank you >> thank you so much thanks thanks to all the panelists I'll uh pass it on to you >> thank Thank you so much esteemed panelist. Uh the thing with such reetting discussions is that nobody wants these discussions to end right but for something else to come up which is also very very interesting. Thank you so much for your time today. And uh a quick recap. Thank you so much. A quick recap for everybody. The future definitely belongs to those institutions that prioritizes skills, employability and the real world impact belonging to AI. AI is definitely not just a tool. It is a redesign trigger. It must be looked at it that way. Deeper collaboration between academia, industry and ecosystem partners is just not essential but it is very critical at this point of time. Curriculum agility is the newest benchmark and it is very important. Talent creation must begin early and it definitely must go on and must be continuous. Finally, employability must be designed and not something hoped for. On that note, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for being with us here today. And the next panel discussion will begin in a few minutes. Till then, thank you so much. While we begin the next session, just wanted to remind you that we are Accenture Learn Vantage. We are also at hall number six where we have the Accenture Learn Vantage Pavilion. There we are helping expo visitors explore how enterprises and institutions can build AI ready talent, preparing leaders and translating learning into real workforce impact. We will begin the second panel shortly. The second learn vantage panel is called transforming enterprises for the age of intelligence. This panel focuses on how Genai is structurally redesigning the work, skills and leadership and what enterprises must do across industry, across academia and across ecosystems to move from experimentation to scalable value. The panel will deliberate upon how enterprise reinvention is about work is about skills and about leadership not just knowledge of AI tools and that talent strategy is what is needed the most attention. So I'd like to invite on stage the esteemed panel. First I'd like to invite Mr. Datri Salagame who's the CEO, president and MD of Bosch Global Software Technology Private Limited, BGSW. Welcome Datatri. In his current role as the CEO and MD at Bosch Global Software Technologies, Datra leads the company's efforts to drive technology first digital transformations for the world and is looking for further strengthening BGSWS as the global software powerhouse for Bosch and its customers. Next, Miss Swati Sharma. Swati is the chief strategy and growth officer at Accenture Learn Vantage. Swati is a globally recognized executive with over two decades of experience driving strategic growth, innovation and digital transformation across industries. Currently serving as the chief strategy and growth officer at Learn Vantage. She leads global expansion, ecosystem partnerships and investment strategy. Third, our third panelist is Mr. Arif Khan. Please welcome Mr. Arif Khan, chief innovative chief innovation officer at Razer Pay. And as the CIO of Razer Pay, Arif is primarily responsible for leading the banking, risk management, regulatory affairs and public policy teams towards larger organizational revision of fine-tuning Razer Pay's offerings in the digital payment space. Again, we would like to welcome Deepika Kapoor. Deepipika Kapoor just uh moderated the previous session. Thanks Deepika and welcome back again. Deepika is the head industry partnerships and marketing at NASCOM. Deepika has been playing a key role in shaping national level skilling initiatives and aligning industry needs with workforce readiness. Her work her work focuses on creating measurable impact at scale through partnerships and innovations. So without much ado, let's begin the second learn vantage panel. Over to you Deepika. >> Thank you so much. I thought I would get a breather but nevertheless. [laughter] Wonderful. Thank you so much for everybody for joining in today. Again, welcome to the session and I know um you know you've been braving enough all this walk and the rain. So grateful for all of you to fool the house here and thanks a lot. We are here seeing so much done in the spare of AI. So many tools available you know I mean while we were all walking through this expo we've seen that there are so much innovation happening in the space of AI so much intelligence floating around. However, there is this pressing question uh of how the enterprises are you know looking forward to adopting all these changes with the so much already being done uh and there is a format where the workspace has already been working for so many years. So how do we see that you know this uh break neck speed of change which is coming through AI how do we how as an enterprises all of you are you know working towards bringing this change on ground changing the work culture and adopting AI Arif I would like to start from you if you can give your perspective of how do you see this change is impacting the enterprise >> uh sure uh thanks uh thanks guys I'm Arif I'm from Razer Pay and if you're wondering Who's powering the payments in this event? It's a raise up. Okay. So, and we have got our sales guys up here. So, >> super. Raise your hands please. [laughter] >> Okay. Uh, cool. Right. So, uh, and I'll, you know, so obviously I don't come from the academia. I'm not on the HR side of life, right? So, I'm just going to tell you my life as a manager or maybe as a leader and what I've been through, right? And what's happening, right? I think uh fundamentally a uh while we talking about AI today I think it's been there for a while right it's been evolving I hear a lot of buzz over here about uh you know she mentioned about these tools etc but that's not something that is worrying me I know there is a form a lot of you have like you know you hear a word replet then you hear the word MCP then you you hear things like claude but that's not necessarily that's worrying to me I think different agents different tools that's how I look at them and over a period of time we'll master some of them and you'll keep having this evolvement right around it. Uh when I when I look at it structurally there are two three things that come to our mind right and I think uh Mr. Nandan Lankani was talking about it yesterday. He mentioned this and since I spent a decade and a half a bank I could relate to it right. I think one fundamental challenge that I see is earlier we used to have you know systems which were legacy let's say a two decade old architecture existing in the organization then we built some middleware over it and then we started making a front end over it. So at any point in time it was a very hybrid data center if you've ever visited right some old technologies some new technologies and some leading customerf facing technologies right but now with AI coming in I don't think so you can have this siloed anymore I think that's one change that people need to understand over and beyond the agents that we talk about in the tools I think so if you look at any uh traditional large organization and uh I think uh my colleague on the panel would probably be more accurate with numbers But the estimate that we typically have is 60% of the budget right goes towards maintaining and sustaining what is legacy and around 30 40% is about what is current and new and I think the idea is that hey how do you go to 70% which is new and how do you make sure that you know it's only 30% to sustain right in terms of your budget now that's one problem on the infra and tech side we really need to solve I think the other challenge and I again I'll give you with a razor pay example right we were trying to uh we onboard merchants and we were trying to simplify the journey right and at that stage when we started this we were looking at AI as a bolt-on so you bolt something on and it could make it faster more efficient right so what could happen let's say earlier in 7 hours we were saying hey can it happen in 3 hours what could happen in 3 hours can it happen in 1 hour what required like six people behind it can it be done in one person right we did that we got some efficiency but that's when we realized right when one of our younger guys asked this question. It's not how do I automate it? How do I you know make this agent work? I think the question that really was the bright moment for us is we said we went back and we asked the question why this thing exists. I think the moment we started asking ourselves the question why the process it helped us. I'll give you a small example right uh when the first electric motors came in they were used for doing a particular function right. Uh let's say let's take the steam engine. Initially the steam engine when it came in it was used to pump out the water from the coal mines right so what people did is uh when it was doing that they replaced the steam engine with a electric engine and that's where they left it. What it did is gave them some 10 15 20% efficiency. No one imagined at that time that look you could take the electrical engine and actually start looking at the entire process right and imagine again for example the steam engine had a process they had these conveyor belts that continued as it is it took them 30 years to realize that look now you have electric motors and you can place them on each belt and you could do it very differently I think so the question would be more for us and I think that's where this panel probably will discuss a bit more is how do you do a lot of unlearning and then what happens to your talent around it right I think that's the fundamental question that we need to answer that's something that used to worry us a couple of years back but I think now we have fig at least we believe so that we are on the right path that we're saying look I don't think it's about the end state it's not about being very deterministic anymore it's about how do we ask the right questions and the question always is why does the process exist it's not the question that what AI can do in the process so I'll Thank you so much uh Arif and Swati I mean you've you've already like kind of spearheading all the strategy and the growth perspective for a big firm and from the structural legacy perspective what do you think enterprises need to earn learn to unlock AIEL reinvention >> I think Arif just nailed it so uh he used a word reimagine I think that's the crux of if any enterprise which is looking to maintain their edge in this age of intelligence then it has to be the power of reimagine the organizations which can reinvent themselves. It's not a one-time process. It's a continuous process. But if they can reimagine the work, if they can reimagine the jobs, if they can reimagine the skills which are going to be required to be relevant to be ahead in the market like he introduced, we are empowering the digital payments of India. So they reimagined the payments structure. Okay, it came because of pandemic or it came because of XYZ that doesn't matter. But the organizations who have the ability to re-imagine are the ones who will be taking the lead in in next few generations. That's how I would say that uh we can break that mental model. >> Super. Thank you so much. And this one is for you. So from the CEO's perspective, right? I mean uh what is the hardest thing to earn learn when scaling AI across a large enterprise organizational structure decision rights talent model and leadership mindset so in terms of we're talking about restructure reinvention and you know learning or learning so what from your perspective uh at the helm of it what do you think should be the one uh take on this >> thanks for uh having me here you need to bear with my funnyl looking voice you know like people blame Bangalore traffic. I can blame it on Delhi pollution. Um so I come from a uh industry which is in a in a very uh big transition actually. Uh we can automate a lot of engineering. At the same time no one none of you will drive a car which is completely engineered using AI. I'm sure you know you want airbags to open at the right time. You want the safety of the car to function you know flawless because a factor of safety in a car is more than 100%. So while certain aspects of life cycle of product development of uh uh automotive engineering value stream can be done using AI but there are a lot of subcomponents which are still have to be done extremely uh with safety in you know focus. So we are an industry in transition. You know while we know that there will be a day when we design lot of our subsystems using AI as an engineering force AI at the center but in the next 3 to 5 years we need to we need to develop many of your systems as we were doing it some years back. So what does it mean for us to it's almost like running two modes of the same organization right? There's one mode which has very deep domain knowledge of electromechanical systems and which is your bread and butter and it we know that it is going to run for next 10-15 years. At the same time there are subsystems where you're unbundling hardware and software and that part would be extremely AI. So you run two organizations in the same company actually. So from a structure standpoint what you uh what you asked uh you need to have again you know two formats because if I have an organization which is 35,000 people you don't have to move all 35,000 people onto an AI paradigm overnight. So you need to calibrate your velocity and appetite for change and create an organization which makes sense. I think for us protecting the leadership uh is extremely important because our leadership represent many years of if you can call it as tribal knowledge of the domain automotive industry. Now we need to protect that while bringing them up to the world of AI. So that's the transition which we are going through now. >> Wonderful. And I think what we're talking here is the absolutely a new operational model where human and AI is coming together you know augmenting each other to face the future of work and Arif uh I think this would be for you in terms of how the roles are being redesigned and what stays humanled and what becomes AI assisted. >> So actually have a very different view to what uh Mr. the TI said right uh but with due respect right I I I I think like you know uh let me talk about myself right I it's like a midlife crisis uh you know at my age so-called leadership right I think the biggest challenge in AI is the leadership right uh a lot of us including me we lack what I call u intellectual humility uh so a lot of my knowledge is based on certain domains like so how did I grow in life right it's a secret source some of you may want to pick it up I learned one domain went very deep got known for it kept building on it and over a period of time your organization recognizes you and you grow right I think and that knowledge was with me I think AI completely takes away right the information and knowledge is available abundantly now right so what is AI in a way it's a partner to you everything that was institutionalized within you now is now available for everybody there could be a new kid on the block who has access to all that information what he doesn't have is your ability to pass the judgment on it right so I think that's the fundamental different way at least I would like to look at it so when we talk about this back and razor pay I fundamental question to all of us right anyone you know it's difficult to you know put a to it but we keep telling ourselves that anyone who's about 23 years old and working with razor pay then you're not born in the AI era right so you know I think it I forgot the person's name I think it was skulls who mentioned it right when you are on a new paradigm. You will not wait to get consent from people who are opponents of it. What you will get is a new generation that will come in who are born in that paradigm and they'll make it a success. But the problem that we have today in the industry is most of us like leadership. I'm definitely not the you know probably I'm the second last generation right I'm not the new generation. So how in midlife do we adopt it and that's where in my mind intellectual humility what I mean by that everything that I knew has to be now unlearned what and again over here you know when we talk about like sir was mentioning about two organizations we don't see it that way right the way we look at it is like every individual within the organization has a certain skill set right talents right but a skill set it's a composition of many things I'll give you an example like we have people who you know on the data science side right around 150 of them now by default it's table stake that they write very good models efficient and all those kind of I think that's a given and I don't we really don't value them for that what we want them is to go upper in the you know uh in thought process where they're saying like look do you understand the nuance of cash flow of a D2C company visav a supply chain company and that's a human judgment right so we Look at AI as a partner right who has all the repository all the information how could you come together and pass the judgment another thing sorry if I'm prolonging it we don't see you know there's this classic question right uh if you juggle with AI uh whether human in between or human at hand right and we really we are not the ones who believe that human should be in between we believe human at hand right it's the higher decision that human will take right for example we talk about trust by design I mean you look at UPI right uh for from an inclusion point of view it's not a bolt-on it's not that you had UPI and then you said oh we want to do this in tier three the design stage you made sure that the right trust architecture the right inclusion structure was included and then you could add to it so I think the human role will evolve there and if anybody who stands in the way of this is going to be people like me who are the leadership team so the biggest challenge for AI is not that the youth adopting new tools or understanding is el I would call elderly old people like me who become roadblocks. So I think that's the undoing and I don't think there's an like again right we don't see AI as an initiative or as a feature we see it at the operating layer that's about it right everything built everything shipped it has to be behind it if not I think it's a existential crisis for us it's not what you can do with AI it's what you will become as an organization with AI so that's the way we look at it slight difference of opinion but let's see >> I think it's u if I may add depends on when you were born. Bosch was born 140 years back and hence you know you need to manage the legacy of uh 140 year old company and the biggest biggest value of an organization now if you're heading strategy or if you're heading you know important function like CTO is to design a velocity pragmatic velocity with which you carry the organization. There is plenty of noise around AI. There is plenty of substance in AI. Now how do you choose for your organization? It's like human body. You cannot you know transplant anybody's organ to you. So you need to figure out the velocity and the volume of the technology transformation that suits your organization because digital native organization that you are is born in a different era and an organization that has seen two world wars has to transition into an era where a consumer who is sitting in the car and the car is designed for the consumer and not for the car performance. So that is a transition we are going through. So there are two trajectories and there is no formula for transformation. add one more thing right this is good fun maybe next year we'll come back >> I want to add as well >> right so you know we figured out >> so guys my job is done >> so yeah so within uh within our organization we would have like millions and millions of lines of code right uh we are organization which is 11 years now and when we sat back and thought to ourselves what if we have to build razor pay code by code line by line again from scratch uh in today's time it would take us 6 months and the very fact that we are 11 year old and obviously not 140 but we already feel that we are from the jurassic age and hence the need for the transition but I'll take a bet next year we'll catch up again for sure >> no >> I do this panel every year >> and and and I love to be sitting between two generations right now you know you can hear in the room uh what we are talking what an organization which is digital native is facing as AI uh how they are bringing AI to their life and an organization which is running for ages is also bringing AI to their life and both of them are equally passionate about leveraging what AI can do. However, both of them agree and you both can disagree if you feel that discretionary part of this whole era both of them are clearly articulating wants to be with human. So I think that's the crux that if AI can do all the periphery but discretionary remains with the human beings that is where we will get on to the re reimagine and reinvention of of the organizations. That's that's a wonderful perspective and I think what we we started the conversation was of course how human and AI are coming together to take this ahead. So definitely uh I think we're all aligned on that thought at least. So great to hear that. So uh datas this is another one for you in terms of uh where are you personally choosing to double down on consciously slow down investment and what signals guide those decisions in terms of embedding this whole AI transition into the enterprise so what is your perspective on the investments there >> no that's a very apt question uh about 10 years back so we the entire automotive industry decided on uh what is is now called a software definfined vehicle. So you fundamentally unbundle hardware and software and you define the car of the future using software. All of us spend billions and billions of dollars on it to make software like a cell phone where you can upgrade the car regularly without changing the hardware. Now this product side hypothesis has not taken off because I mean the value stream between the OE tier one and the consumer is not very very clear. Now who pays whom is not very obvious. So what we are slowing down a little bit is uh our investment on software defined vehicle how we deliver what are the features that we deliver in software defined vehicle. Now we are we are on a search for real value items of software defined vehicle and not you know I'll control your cars light remotely you know this is not what is giving you revenue streams so we are slowing down a little bit on that but what we are amping up is leveraging AI for our own software development you know what we visualize is about 30 to 35% of our software development will be completely taken over by AI tools uh overseen by senior developers including safety relevant software development. So we are really investing heavily on that. >> So how far do you see the entire shift to autonomous vehicle when you're saying that you know you're not kind of bringing in technology to let go the human element from driving everybody's favorite question. [laughter] you know that was the mother of all AI problems we wanted to solve right uh you know you won't believe the some of the marauti vehicles uh in India are powered by the AI models the data trained by our team for Indian conditions in fact my team took me to my home from my office in Guramangala I am still alive so it works but a lot of training has to be Not for level three and above but level two two and a half it really works. >> Super super. And we talking about trust and governance here. So Arif in terms of guardrails I mean what do you see are the non-negotiable when scaling AI responsibly. I so I I think this is where the human element uh comes in right at uh multiple uh levels right one of the things that I keep telling uh people is so for example uh we recently launched what we call agentic payments right so what it means is you know if you're on a swiggy zamato it's in early days you could have conversations with swiggy zamato and within that make let's say you know just say that hey I want to order uh you know what let's say a soap or I want to order a burger and the payment just goes through. I hope some of you have experienced it right. I mean so earlier my wife used to tell me I was the agent and now it's been actually replaced by AI right that's so some of these things that we've been doing now uh when you when you come come back to this guardrails right my my worry is I think we tend to write uh policies right and policies are usually very very certain and we are in uncertain times so if you write policies which are very certain I think it will really bring down the pace of innovation. So that that's one worry. I understand guardrails are important. Uh but at the same time I think uh coming from a UPI background in my previous role in NPCI, I think uh what's important is that the policy should be manifested not in the paper but in your architecture. I think that what brings out the safety and the control and uh those kind of things right. I think the governance side needs to focus a lot where people are not in between trying to do operational recon and all but it should focus more towards like hey uh uh you know uh are we doing the right kind of inclusion what are the ethnic uh ethic ethical questions that we are answering but overall I think while my view on governance it needs to be you know if you're racing F1 any of you guys watch F1 right it should be like those sand pits right on some sharp turns right what it does it doesn't put a break to you. It just slows you down a bit, helps you get back into the right direction and then move on from there. But if the governance structure or compliance structure is where it puts you to a halt, red flags you, I think then the country or we as a society will lose, right? I don't think this is the right stage for it. Yes, some controls because we are a very large country, different uh you know different segments, tier four, tier five, people below the poverty line, etc. some guardrails but let's not get overboard with it that that's always my worry >> u and swati to you I mean u again from the lens of trust and governance so there is lot which is shifting to AI agents in terms of analytics in terms of you know uh maybe research etc so what do you think is something that we can let go as an enterprise and what is where we would want to kind of keep it like a human centric or human-driven uh operation So is there any you know blur or a thin line to think think of I think the organizations which are trying to close their eyes thinking AI is just a gimmick it'll vanish it'll go away then let me tell them uh please wake up AI is not here to go away it's not a gimmick it's not a tool it's not a a a toy which somebody's is trying to push for all of us to buy from a store. AI is truly transforming the way we do businesses. I'll tell you a little bit about Axenture. Now, Accenture is a 700,000 plus people company globally and more than half of the headcount of this overall number is based out of India. Now you tell me that Accenture you are talking about AI is taking over. Why do you have so many people? Why do you need so many people to do the work? The answer to that question is we are re-imagining the work with AI. We are not replacing AI. AI is not replacing us. the more we will learn how AI needs to be embedded in our lives, not as a gimmick, not as a tool, but reimagining the work what we are trying to do today versus tomorrow. we will be on that success path and that is what we are we as an organization Accenture is bringing to all of our clients and Accenture learn Vantage is leading that pack for providing that right skill providing that right bridge that what should be the combination of reimagining of your job description like my friend was talking RF was talking about data engineer what is expected out of a data engineer. You should be having these 20 things. You should be able to analyze this. You should be able to do this and that's about it. But tell me now Arif with AI influence how the job of your data engineer looks like is going to change. >> He's more of a business person than ever. Right? So I I think that's why I let me try and explain give a very slightly different point of view. get the attention out of Razer Pay and myself, right? So, you know, you go to any AI event and when there are thought leaders talking, they'll talk about the printing press, right? Any of you attended AI event, they're talking about the printing press, what it did, what it did. Essentially, what they say is the information which was in the monastery with a few priests is now available to public and how it helped and all. Uh, so there's this lady, right? I think it was in the early 18th century. I don't remember the date. I think Elizabeth Einstein, sort of a philosopher, really like her. uh uh there's something very strange she noted right when the small printing press came in okay uh you know you who used to hang around at the small printing press uh so she observed something very unique it was the scholars it was the merchants it was the craftsmen so three very different skills which were very siloed earlier they were the people who were at the uh small printing press having conversations together very different skill concept right and then synthesizing that synthesizing of skills of different views is what we call polymat today right who's a very well-known polymat today daraini right daraini was just not an artist he used to do many other things he was a craftman he had blah blah blah blah and many other skills right and what it meant is they had very different skill sets coming together and they were able to explore and imagine so much more as you said right the classical question we ask ourself is what will ex uh AI will do X, human will do Y. I don't think so there's a line and bifurcation in that. I think they'll partner. The question we have to ask ourselves as managing leaders is earlier you were managing a set of people. Now you're managing a set of agents and people to synthesize together and people's job in that will be to ask those questions where what computer to other computer can AI not think about and I can think about. I think that's the key. That's the key. All right. And if we don't solve for that, I think we are really going to be behind the race, right? So look the earlier again like people talk about uh the electric engine, steam engine, they talk about printing press and they try we try to compare it, right? Because that's what we are as humans. We try to compare go back in history. But there has never been a moment like AI like before, right? It can think for itself, right? An AI a bot today is capable that if you if it gives you a piece of code you don't accept the code there's a case that has happened recently it went out and made a public post about the technology guy about the guy who was a coder that this guy doesn't know what is code right so it is imagining it's thinking right so this this paradigm shift we've never been seen before the closest that it comes which we don't have a lot of history about is when human beings started writing right that the first time we started writing I mean if you go and we don't have enough history and archives about it right this is the closest moment that comes to it so this is going to be very different the dig I was part of the digital moment right in banks right I think we did it in like what five years the best banks did in five years the slower banks did it probably in 10 years right we had a chance we did incremental things we never re we use the word reimagine as a strategy conversation but no one really reimagined right we just did delta in case but now is completely changing I don't think we have the time and I don't think we should get debate who does X and what does Y, right? I think we have to think as a polymath and polymats are the ones who will survive. And to be a polymath, you really don't need to be a AI guy. You don't need to be a technology guy. You just need to be a thinker who keep asking himself a lot of questions and keeps rediscovering in this uncertain world that hey, what am I supposed to do? I I'm not a >> No, no, that's a great perspective and thank you. And I'll just finish my thought on on this thing. So, just to give anecdotal on that, right? So you remember the Sony days, the Kodak days, photography was a skill, taking pictures was a skill. If if I ask you today, uh how many photographers in this room? I think everybody will raise hand because it's part of your smartphone and as smartphone owners, you all can click pictures and you all click pictures. So all of you are photographers. You all are having a skill which was a distinct skill maybe 10 years ago when Kodak and Sony thought that nobody can replace us. So the point I was trying to derive at was that skill is evolving and like he said it's no longer one skill will make you survive or one way of thinking one way of processing information one way of doing things will survive because AI is learning side by side what you're doing today AI is in your phone today they are learning everything how you use your phone what do you do in the morning what do you do Next, what do you do when you log in in your office laptop? Like he was saying, his car is learning how he drives every morning to his office to Kor Mangla. Where does he stop? Where does he get past? What does he what time does he uh attend his meetings etc. So AI is learning everything what we are trying to do. So how we will survive with AI is that we have to give them the next thing what they need to learn from us and that's how we collaborate and we work together. I wish I had slight inclination of AI when I was in class 10th and 12th and could have learned so quickly and you know possibly performed as well. [laughter] No great wonderful. >> You can always start. That's a that's a wonderful perspective. And before going to my last question to the panel, I would like to open it to the house because I think we're having some very interesting viewpoints here. So if anybody has any question, please feel free to come in here. Yeah. >> [snorts] >> Uh thank you for a very engaging session and um uh my name is I think you would like me to introduce myself Sunita Honda. I'm a techno bankanker. Uh many uh tech enterprises the major ones they have announced that they don't need coders anymore. Just a few years back they were deploying um them in thousands. Many law firms they are saying uh that we don't need people who used to draft planes or many jobs. Same way the analysts etc. these jobs are going and uh where people uh you know thousand people were there now they need only 100 of the firms. So uh when I wear my um career counselor's uh c hat hat uh for my child or say for any student uh what do I say okay don't become a coder don't become a business analyst don't become become a risk this thing so what you know four or five careers you would suggest that I I can say okay aim for this so what new opportunities will uh come I mean apart from uh saying that become an AI creator. How many of them are needed AI creators? So, um I think if each panelist including the moderator gives two suggestions, I'll have eight carriers to talk about [laughter] there. >> You want me to go? So, uh first of all, the lady who just stood up is the ex SBI uh and she led the digital banking in the largest public sector bank in the country. I thought we should come together recognizing. >> So, I I can tell you from what I tell my kids, right? and uh my uh better half much better half she thinks differently from me. So right now she's winning I'm not. Uh but like I just tell the kids you know just get the basic right learn your values. I don't I I don't think we should uh be telling people what to choose as their careers right so the only thing I like to tell my kids is learn to deal deal with uncertainty learn to deal with a whole lot of uncertainty learn to live with anxiety and keep understanding that things will keep changing. The only constant now is going to be solid change right so you you know you have to just pull out your best survival instinct right it's unlike when you know we were trying to clear our graduation postgraduation software engineer lawyer medical five six choices I don't I think those days are gone behind us right so the way I look at it right there are three uh if you break down a career maybe you know better like so there are these things which involve repetitive task there are things that require cognitive task and there is the creation side of it clearly anything that is repetitive is going to go away. So I I think that's where I tell the kid like you know hence like education is important but education and value is important right everything which is monastery information or institution information is going to be available to them right and they can validate and do that right so I my suggestion would be like hey a don't get stressed because I don't get stressed about my kids anymore just let them deal with anxiety right that's that's about it and that's the reality of today's life I mean that's the real world out there with all the geopolitics everything that is going to happen will there be turmoil in the job market possibly yes but if they are creative enough they'll find a way and what that way is I really don't have the answer but that's the way it should be I'll attempt that you know I'm I'm very I'm very happy that my kids have passed that age I think uh more than what you learn uh to build skills and ability to learn new things is more important uh problem solving across disciplines is something which will be very handy you know because you we were in the past we built our careers specializing in a very highly specialized highly you know compartmentalized uh world but today value is created out of interdicciplinary you know uh working models. So ability to work across domains and ability to solve problems how to learn if they learn how to learn that would be more useful when they build careers. But I think as as parents perhaps we should start looking at their future not with the lens of the past as career because if we are extrapolating the past and visualize them doing the same thing in the future it's tough because I don't think I can visualize someone working for 35 years in a same company or same industry day after day doing you know a linearly growing that model is out I guess >> I think My simple council will be after 10 years there will be no IT jobs. So don't waste your time in learning any programming language, any AI tool. There will be no jobs in the IT in 10 years. What you should counsel is learn about how AI to make work for you. AI can make money for you in a stock market. AI can do data analysis job for you. You need to set up four, five, six data models around you which are making money the paper money for you and you are actually engaged with a curious mind. Either you are educating or you are doing what you love doing. That would be my counsel. >> Asking your kids to behave like bosses. Get agents to work for you. uh which course to pursue what will the answer >> please visit learn vantage website. Okay. Thank you. >> Yeah. So there is there's lot lot to explore online. Anybody else uh wants to Yeah, please. >> Yeah. My question is to all three of you. So I want to start by saying that uh >> you're not very audible. Can you just speak it? >> Okay. Uh am I audible now? >> Okay. Uh yeah. So my question is to all three of you. So there's currently like a race for what you can do in AI. There's uh companies shipping out MCPs and uh agentic workflows to streamline your processes. But uh there's also a growing concern for security because agentic workflows gives uh AI more autonomy and more autonomy also means that it's efficient operations but also at the same time you're compromising your security. What is your approach to like finding a balance between security and efficiency in your AI strategy? >> The way I look at it, there's nothing wrong in being autonomous, right? The purpose of delegation is to be autonomous and that's where you talk about uh trust architecture and design, right? I mean, you cannot I mean I'm guessing you're from the infosc world or leaning towards the infosc world as a career or whatever. You cannot have security as an afterthought, right? And that's where the human role is there to think in the design stage. If you've thought through that and UPI is a very great example in this country, right? Really thought to uh architecture and security by design. If you have that and it's not on paper, it's in the actual architecture that's what protects you, right? And that's the key. So not to be taken lightly but the fundamental rule will always be in the world of agents that what is the role you do? What is the design you have on day one? Have you tried any payment agents? Oh yeah, I'm an active user of uh multiple LLMs. I've built trappers in the past. Yeah, >> we'll chat offline. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> So, um I will just add to your uh question just one point there. Look at an enterprise level the AI implementation is pretty slow. When I say that uh there are lot of guard rails. It is a controlled version. So in every any big organization you will go you will see an enterprise version of copilot and you will see an open version of copilot which is out there. So what does this enterprise version really means? What it really means is it has got all the guardrails which as an enterprise which as a regulatory body the enterprise has to follow have been instilled in the main LLM model itself which is why you always see these enterprise versions which are running in large organizations. So it is pretty secured and pretty controlled. I think u what she said is true at an enterprise level it's highly guarded you air on the other side you know you hold a bit of creativity in a large enterprise to govern the enterprise more but when you are building a product which has agents with a build and buy strategy of agents then you need to really build a have a design for security at a very early stage now and is very contextual you know what kind of applications you build how mission critical it is and how safety relevant it is. I think that's what matters when you use the agents. I would I would choose my criteria very carefully depending on the context. >> Yeah. Yeah. I agree and I think from the onset uh while building itself you need to consider all of these things >> industry standards for that matter right >> there needs to be a stack and that needs to be followed very religiously to scale responsibly. Uh I think we're almost on the top of the hour. Can we take one last question? >> Okay. Yeah. Just last one for the day. >> Take this. >> Sorry. >> Hello. Hello. Yeah. Am I audible? >> Yeah. Thank you for a very uh enlightening talk. So my name is Rahul Kisu. Uh am I audible now? Yeah. So my name is Rahul Kisku. I'm from uh construction background. So now um going through the entire expo and and attending some talks I can fairly see the penetration has been quite quite a lot compared to what is happening in my industry. So now with the advent of AI it's it risk of getting overtaken a little more and why I say this is because our use cases are and probably it changes in real time very often. So we talk we uh work with stakeholders I mean very frequently we we work with the municipal governments and we work with vendors contract subcontractors everything and the the situation changes like anything. So now since it's a it's a very complex use case or complex solution that we have to provide in a project in a project scenario. Now, how do you think we should navigate and leverage this AI to, you know, easing out the workflows or making decisions because I say uh I'll give you a uh real-time example. uh I had to go through thousands of hundreds of mail to understand which is my requirement where should I give approvals and to at least get the trail of thought key what specifications are being asked for and is this the correct one that the that my clients requires it right now because the clients also changes scope frequently and that is because the real world also changes quite quite frequently. Now in this sort of a situation where the uh use case or where the ask is uh quite fleeting you kind of like you are targeting a fleeting fleetating target. How do you think we should navigate this AI? your question seemed to be more like an explanation but [laughter] anyway so I mean I I don't know about my co-panelist but since you were looking at me then uh I'm not from the construction industry myself uh but I could just imagine a few >> you are the smartest of all >> no no I I'm just unlearning a lot many things right I mean like uh you look at it right so there's some construction happening I mean you can observe construction all over Bombay I don't know about Delhi that much uh but one of the things that I See, because there's a metro coming up next to my house that there is looks like someone who's a supervisor. He comes at around 10:30. There's a bunch of guys who are, you know, different kind of labors, different things. They wait for him to turn up at 10:30 and turn by turn he gives them instructions what to do, right? And I see them spending at least one hour over there. I have a very simple question because they're from industry. When a labor turns up and he usually turns up at 9:45 because the babu supervisor turns up at 10:30. uh why does he know beforehand what he has to do when correct I actually tried asking this to them because they need to know I have to go to the third floor and put what they call plinth I don't know whatever that means one guy has to go somewhere and put some fabrication of some windows or something I'm just making this up on the fly right they don't seem to have that they rely on this supervisor to come who has a mental map who will do what because he's doing delegation of responsibility and orchestration right who will do that there's a lot of time and effort energy just wasted on that right I mean if that if you could just pick that up right and I don't even know whether you really need AI for it but if you could just automate that how much time and energy will you spend on that right that's one second how do you pay people you pay people on events right they've completed a task they've not completed a task right I think some of these things are the easier ones maybe you should just get claude or something ask them a bit of questions and we'll tell you what to do next but I mean I think we can't say that because it's very complex X AI cannot play a role probably it's a lot of complexity because of repetitive work because this supervisor in my mind is being very repetitive work he's just issuing instructions he's not really doing a very creative thinking he's not the architect design of how the building should look right so in my view just because it's a physical world and assuming that AI cannot do a lot of role over there answer is no it is maybe the physical labor part of it robots and all coming in that could take a little more time and I think Bosch would probably be the best people to answer that question right? >> Are we selling robots now? >> That was a good leg glance towards me. You know, I mean any any industry you need to look at the value stream and you need to look because AI implementation is expensive. Figure out feasibility versus you know what solves in that value stream and pick those which are of high impact and high feasibility and solve that first. As he said, there are a lot of lowhanging topics done extremely manually throughout the value stream of some of these industries and I think there are many of low hanging topics which you can uh automate using readily available AI solutions at a planning stage, material selection side, labor planning, labor payments, project planning etc. So while your question is very vast I mean so the answer is also a bit generic. >> I'm itching sorry I will just say one thing. Are you angry with AI? >> Why it is late in your industry? >> No, actually I'm not angry. Actually, in fact, my company is in India, one of the leading implementer of digitization whatever is happening in the construction space right now. But I'm still not content with what we have achieved with it right now. So I'm just picking your brains just to I mean is there anything that we can do more about it? I think uh as both the gentlemen said it has got absolute innumerable use cases to solve but where do you start? You start with the most dynamic use case like you gave the email example just to be on top of your requirements. You can absolutely use an AI engine running on your emails to give you a daywise summary every morning which are your top five things you need to solve for and what is the last information you've received from client or from your lead engineer or whoever uh which is the last information and synthesize it for me to be able to give it to my project team to my sales team to this team and that team. So all of this thing can be easily synthesized by an AI engine for you and you can be just going in the action mode and the AI can do all the research and analysis for you. That is a starting point. >> I I'll just add when all this gan that we gave you and doesn't work, don't worry. Come to Razer Pay. We do escrow management for construction and building properties to manage your workflows in terms of your cash flows and we really do a great job of it. And it's got AI behind you. You don't need to worry about it. So, Suraj, you've got a lead now. Okay. >> So, one great learning is that you definitely have to be your brand evangelist. Super. Thank you so much for an interesting conversation. Thank you audience. You were great everybody. >> Thanks so much. Thanks, Swati. Thanks Arif. Thanks Datri and thanks Deepipika for moderating these two sessions. So at the end of the day today we have established that the AI economy will not only be powered by technology or talent alone it will be both. We had backto-back two sessions while one panel focused on enterprise work systems leadership and talent architecture. The other panel focused on institutions and education systems talent creations at scale and future employability pipelines. Just to remind you we are at hall number six where we can you can visit us again. We are the talent creators. We are Accentia Learn Vantage. >> Thank you. Thanks everyone.
