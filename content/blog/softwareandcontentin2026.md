I've been wrestling with a strange paradox lately: the easier it becomes to build software and create content, the more urgent it feels to ***start right now***.

Let me explain what I mean.

The Bell Curve Nobody's Talking About

When [vibecode.dev](https://vibecode.dev), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), and [Emergent Labs](https://apps.apple.com/app/emergent-labs/id6740034053) hit the internet, something clicked for me. These weren't products from decade-old companies with hundreds of engineers. These were applications built at speeds that would have seemed impossible a few years ago - vibecoding, as we are now calling it(Terrible name btw, undermines a lot of impactful work being done in this space).


The bell curve of "who can build software" isn't just shifting. It's exploding outward in every direction. And here's what keeps me up at night: we're still on the early side of that curve. The left side, where being early still means something.

### The Content Production Revolution You're Already Living Through

Think about what creating a YouTube video meant in 2019. You needed a decent camera setup, lighting that didn't make you look like you were recording from a basement (even if you were), hours of video editing software expertise, and then more hours crafting thumbnails, descriptions, and keywords. 

A single 10-minute video could consume an entire weekend. Now? Record a one-hour conversation. Feed it to something like [Overlap.ai](https://overlap.ai). The system analyzes your content, identifies the compelling moments, generates clips optimized for different platforms, suggests posting schedules, tracks performance metrics, and even scores which segments resonate most across mediums. What took a weekend now takes an afternoon. What took a team now takes you.

But here's the thing that's both exhilarating and terrifying: ***this isn't the ceiling. This is the floor***.


### Why "Anyone Can Do It" Is Both True and Misleading

Yes, the barriers have collapsed. Yes, anyone can build software or create content at scale now. But there's a crucial distinction between **can** and **will**.

The people publishing content online today - the ones building audiences, the ones shipping products are not necessarily more talented than you. They're not hiding some secret knowledge. What they have is consistency. They showed up, they shipped, they kept going when the first few attempts went nowhere.

And now, with AI tools handling the mechanical burden of creation, the game has shifted entirely to one variable: ***your willingness to start and keep going.***

Think about that for a moment. The constraint is no longer "Can I afford the tools?" or "Do I have the technical skills?" The constraint is purely: "Will I do this regularly?"


### The Commoditization of Creation

We're watching two massive shifts happen simultaneously:

**Software is commoditizing**. Not in quality(atleast yet), but in accessibility. The ability to build functional, useful applications is no longer gated behind years of learning syntax and frameworks.

You can describe what you want, iterate with an AI assistant, and ship something real. The craft hasn't been eliminated but the barrier to entry has essentially vanished.

**Content creation is scaling horizontally**. One piece of thoughtful content can become 20 platform-optimized pieces. One insight can reach audiences across mediums without you manually adapting it for each one. High repeatability, zero additional manpower, near-instant replication.

### What does this mean for you and me?

The Window That's Closing While Opening Wider

Here's the paradox I mentioned at the start: as these tools become more powerful and accessible, the advantage of starting early actually increases, even as the barriers decrease.

Why? Because we're in a brief moment where:
* The tools are powerful enough to let you compete with established players
* But not so ubiquitous that everyone has figured this out yet
* The platforms still reward consistent creators
* The audience is still forming habits about where they go for insight

***In 2019***, you needed capital and a team to compete. In 2026, you need consistency and clarity of thought with AI tools.

***In 2028?*** Everyone will have caught on. The commodity tools will be everywhere. The advantage will shift again—probably toward those with the strongest distribution, the clearest voice, the most authentic connections.

Right now, you can build both the distribution and the content simultaneously. You can ship software that solves your own problems and attract people who have those same problems. You can share your learning process and build an audience while you're still figuring things out.

This might be one of the best moments in history to be an independent creator-builder. Not because it's easy-it's never been easy to create something meaningful—but because the ratio of effort-to-impact has never been more favorable for individuals.

### What I'm Doing About It

I'm treating 2026 as a forcing function. I'm not just building software as work items or checking boxes on a product roadmap. I'm thinking about the larger picture: ***What problems actually matter? What would I build if I could build anything? What insights am I developing that might help someone else avoid the mistakes I'm making?***

And I'm publishing. Not perfectly, not with everything figured out, but consistently. Because the people who are winning this game aren't the ones waiting for perfect conditions. They're the ones shipping on Tuesday.
The tools are here. The platforms are open. The only question is whether you'll use them.
