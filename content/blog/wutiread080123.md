#6 Edition of interesting reads from the week - 08, Jan 2023.

Bringing order to chaos in order

With the new year, we all have the urge to settle things down and give things a fresh start over and start with a clean slate to build and do what we always wanted to achieve and grow to the best, most successful version of ourselves.

Binding one to labeled goals is never going to work out as you set yourself out of the blue on a random day of the year. Goals and targets have to be paced and thought well for results and it all starts with building simple habits and building a process around how you want to achieve a certain goal. It shouldn't be hard or something to stress about - initially maybe yes, a little bit it should become a seamless process that takes little to no effort.

Big or small these changes and habits can make waves and probably create more impact than an exhausting not possible to achieve resolution list calendar

Personal branding matters to an extent but what is important is defining your goals as to why you want to build and achieve the personal brand.

Some build it for the clout, others for influence or networking in general. While some people genuinely care about a topic that it makes them share their learnings and insights with the wider world. Rare but appreciated in the Silicon Valley world.

A brand is a living creature and it also evolves with the person building it. It ends up being a reflection of the thoughts and ideas of the creator.

- you don't have to always take these things seriously
- no one knows shit here
Balancing being popular and being someone who talks/shares sense
-  LinkedIn influencers and noise 

if you had to choose what would you do? Choose strong public presences or great private influence with your peers
