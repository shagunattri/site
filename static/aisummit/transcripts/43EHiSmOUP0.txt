giving your time to uh dwell on some of the uh issues. Uh we we have said it is identity paradox because the issue what we are going to discuss the impact of AI what we are going to explore it is bit paradoxical uh and what challenges it imposes on an identity platform like UIDI. We were going to dwell on that and the this is a conversation which which we intend to do with the industry to seek your participation in solving some of these real challenges that we do see with the advent of AI. uh for centuries uh identity is always anchored with the physical presence. When you see somebody, you always believe that he's real. When you see a signature on the check, the whole financial institution works around that fact that if they see a signature on a check, they believe that it is real. And on the identity card if you see a photograph you trust that this person is genuine carrying the identity card. Now with the advent of internet what happened this identity verification shifted from physical domain to to a remote kind of verification. the verifiability context came into the play like if I can verify a biometric which is being offered through a whether in front of an assisted in in in an assisted mode or in a remote process I trust that person so that's the verifiability aspect came with the advent of internet now along with the verifiability also came deception Certain amount of deception was always there in the physical when the physical presence was getting uh was getting trusted that time also deception was there with with the remote verification also deception was there but what happened with the ID uh with AI the deception technique became industrialized the way the fake voice fake fake biometrics, fake facial image that is getting generated. I wouldn't be wrong if I say that the deception technology has matured well and well ahead of it the time and that's why today we are trying trying to understand how do we stop those deception technique and ensure that the broken story of seeing is believing is not going to be a reality. How do we protect the identity platform? So before I move on to some of the opportunities, I would like to take some take a pause and set the context. So if you look at the hard problems of identity, what are the hard problems? The first is inclusivity and why it is more so important because this is a foundational layer in any DPI structure and inclusivity is very very important. So how how it is how it is going to impact when we are speaking in reference to AI how inclusivity matters the models that we use today in UI at UIDI we have bunch of models which are helping us to protect the our platform identity platform they're all inclusive in nature we are rich as a country we are rich with diverse set of demographics We have uh people from uh from various uh I would say various geographies that helps us in training our model and making sure that our model is unbiased and it is helping to ensure inclusivity. But going forward can this inclusivity be extended to the certain set of people who are still not accessing this technology. For example, today we imple we have face authentication in our portfolio. Is the face authentication is completely inclusive? The answer is no. Some subset of special people still they are not in a position to access the face authentication. Can we do something with the use of with the help of technology and bring them on to this portfolio? That is something we would like to have a conversation with the industry. Privacy uh privacy uh if you look from AI point of view, privacy may not be a directly concerning the AI may not have a direct impact on the privacy. But why we are speaking of privacy over here is uh like we used to whenever we used to go to any uh networking conference we always get to hear this that UI is rich with data. Yes. We do have the largest catalog of biometrics data. We do have 170 140 cr of Aadhars with us. We have the demographics. We have the documents. But is this data accessible to us to train the model? The answer is no. We are still a responsible organization. We believe on data minimization, usage of the data of a Aadhaar holder. We do have guardrails to to use this data for any kind of model building. Now why I'm talking this with the community over here is we need to talk we need to understand we need to think about the technologies that is required to leverage this data in a confident in a privacy preserving way. Some of these technologies are already being discussed in many forums but what we need to do is put this technologies into the reality. Right? So that's the that's the privacy part. The trust is like the any identity platform why our AUS and KUS or or our partners they trust our plat the identity uh response that we give because they believe that we have done adequate verification and deliberation when we give out a response to to a request. So that trust needs to be preserved rather it has to be reinforced in the AI domain. Now moving on to the some of the engineering challenges scale and latency we know that when we operate a population scale solution these are some of the things we cannot ignore and our solution has to meet the scale challenges as well as at the same time it has to be low latency. So these are the some of the fundamental concepts that we need to uh be we need to set at the outset when we have the conversation for the opportunities that AI provides. We believe that though AI has an adversial impact on on the identity platform it also brings in lot of opportunity to defend that platform. So uh in 2019 we started this journey with this belief that we can leverage AI to protect this identity platform. We came up with initially we started with a finger livveness project. Today if you see this project has fractified has matured and at scale we perform livveness of each and every fingerprint that enters our platform for verification. That's a that's that's a very the highly recognized success story and inferencing at population scale has al also been recognized in the industry. Now this is our success story around finger but what about the new threats that is emerging because of the AI? Are we really prepared? Yes to some extent to ensure to to ensure the trust around the identity platform but we need to do a bit more on this. We need to so that is the collaborative work that we are uh seeking with the industry so that we develop next generation models to identify the frauds around the authentication around the identity and prevent while it is occurring. That is something we are seeking partnership and my colleague Zach will be covering that in detail. Now moving on from livveness similarly on the biometric side the classical bio biometric dduplication technology perhaps it has come to its end of life. Today the classical algorithms are being replaced with AI based approach. Machine learning models are what we have observed that machine learning models are better at performing accurate matching of the biometrics. Now how do we ensure those models are free from bias, free from uh any kind of uh say it it it it has it it it has to be secured as well as it has to ensure that there is a trust around the matching process. So these are some of the work that as an as a collaborative effort we need to undertake with the industry. Same as OCR uh I'm sure today if you have seen this hall there are lot of stalls around the document processing we also as an identity provider when somebody gets enrolled into our ecosystem or into our platform we do verification based on the document that it it provides. So verifying those documents at scale and also the kind of the diverse set of document that we get some of them in English and most of them in local language how do we interpret that and ensure that the person who is getting onboarded to the platform or doing an update to its claim they are all it is a trusted process. So that is these are the again collaborative effort that we are seeking at this place. Next is the voice assistance. So on the voice front uh we believe that this is going to be a key enabler for us in the in improvising our our connect with the residents. So we will demonstrate some of the work that has been done. We we are one of the early adopters of sovereign models that is being developed within this country on voice front and we have implemented them in order to in order to detect any kind of fraud and reach out to the resident at that point of time and intimate about or taking a confirmation around the event. So this is something we will be demonstrating but this is just a story that is we just started perhaps we need to take scale it out with richer set of models or the technology that is likely to come. Now I mentioned what has worked for us so far and what is to be done. Definitely we have been seen a good amount of success on livveness when whether it is finger livveness or it is fa face livveness also the uh detecting fraud at scale related to biometric capture whether it is capture of the fingerprint or face or iris we have been successful in detecting them with the help of AI but again this is something a game wherein we need to be ahead of the race otherwise we will somebody will try and bring down an identity platform. Uh I was mentioning about the voice on the voice side as I said this is a new channel that that we are leveraging for to to connect with our residents. If you look at today the sovereign models that we have in our country, they're good at communicating with the residents at in their local language following the dialects and the and the uh uh and the language. Right? So we have leveraged some of them. We'll just showcase one demonstration. In this demonstration what we are doing we whenever there is an authentication request comes to our platform we detect whether uh whether this is a fraudulent attempt or or the resident is is impacted because these biometrics are not matching. There are multiple attempts we are seeing and at that point of time we are reaching out to the resident to take a confirmation. And this is an out of band confirmation that we are trying to take from the resident. Excuse me. Audio please. HDFC Banking authent. HDFC Bank HDFC Bank. Thank you. >> Right. So this is where we are using a sovereign model of one of our startups and we have integrated 12th September 2024 center 342 location HDFC Bank Citycess. Huh? appointment experience experience. Thank you. The uh second demonstration is uh is this is getting triggered when whenever you visit any enrollment center of UIDI for any update or enrollment process based on a sampling. We are triggering this voice feedback call and our objective is to identify the experience that resident has has uh the experience of the resident and that is again it it happens within 5 minutes of the transaction and imagine this power of this technology today it is very much doable to reach out to every person who is visiting the UIDI enrollment center and take a feedback and that helps us in preserving that trust around the platform. It will also ensure us to verify whether there is any ground level fraud happening in terms of overcharging for a free transaction that is being offered by UID or that is a fixed price transaction being offered by UID. As I said voice as a capability we have just started. This technology is improv improving day by day. Today in today in on 18th of this month we saw three of our AI startups in this country comes up with the models. This technology is fast evolving and our objective over here is to leverage some of them and build capability which will help us to improvise our engagement with the citizens. So with this I will now hand over to Sridar G wherein he will come and explain or discuss some of the ideas wherein AI can be leveraged for a better engaging experience of the citizen with our platform. Yeah. Uh thank you. Thank you Sabuji. So uh the theme recurring theme uh at the summit so far you have been hearing is all about how uh there's so much energy that is consumed to build these frontier models. uh there is a data point floating that uh there is enough energy consumed by uh all the uh leading frontier models that it can power the entire African continent's electricity needs for a year. So we are hearing these things. The important point that we want to focus on and what we care about at UIDI is what the conference team says welfare for all happiness for all. So as a designer and at and user experience something we care for here uh one of the uh most fundamental barriers for inclusion is language. So uh what we realize is that uh we also know from a lot of the training of uh languages that the intelligence the inference layer uh at the pre-training is 99% in English not just English but probably American English and uh so there's a lot of under representation and that's why there's a strong case even for our sovereign models and things so language is something we are focusing not just because of AI but we realize that that's an important I think even for our 133 cr users who come in every day and don't understand some of the technical nature of some of the documents or verification or even messages like what is authorization and certain terms. So uh we spoke with lot of users and we found there are all kind of challenges people have which are cognitive and so that is uh some of things we try to address. So that is the first issue which uh we feel uh if we address uh strongly in through all the interfaces at various touch points uh of uh UIDI across the country that would be uh make that uh everything uh more accessible. The second issue I want to get to is in terms of how we are approaching it is uh something we're looking at is what happens in from a cognitive load point of view. There are multilingual solutions but it's like uh when you go to a site I mean we have seen the data that 99% of the users are still sticking to the English though we have uh all the major languages represented and why are people not using it. So if you look at it there is the fMRI studies and cognitive neuroscience has shown that actually there are multiple pathways uh to in the uh in the cognition that how we process information as a human and uh the the uh audio the sound takes a different pathway and uh uh site visual cortex dominates most of our processing and our energy as we scroll things. So the uh how do you there is a cognitive loads cost and there's a switch which is why there is another uh reason why people are not able to use multilingual and multimodel so conveniently and so that is something we are trying to keep in mind as we improve and so uh using these thoughts uh some of the uh some of the early experiments like uh Sabuji was saying we are trying out is uh something like a document when you want to do an address update. There are some 30 plus documents that you could uh look at uh and consider. So the person who doesn't understand which document can the system can the interface explain. So the the question they have in mind is uh which is reads as what is it? What is written here? What is there in this document? Uh how do I understand it? And so the advantage we have with the intelligence layer of AI which is something we want to explore is the uh ability to infer context of that user locally on that device and then uh speak out to them. So some of these are some experiments and we have some demos of these we are trying to build and uh so uh so you will see some of these uh uh demos that's uh uh so even in our site uh we want to bring in these are some future future uh looking uh ideas. So how if you look at most language things there is a small button where you switch between English or another language or whatever your preferred language is. But uh what we want to try out and we are in a very early stage is if I can use a formal language which is like English and associate with a secondary a bilingual language which has an explainer. So when I hover on it, I should be able to it should tell me okay what do I find out here in this uh uh site. So it should be able to explain. I think that is a huge benefit that AI offers. And so these are some of the uh directions we are thinking uh in terms of improving inclusion accessibility for a very heterogeneous population. uh so I I I think what are the opportunities and like Sabudi said we need to invite we invite industry and uh experts to collaborate and help us with some of these and uh I would request my colleague Zach to show you the path and how you could work with UID. Thank you. >> Thank you sir. >> Good afternoon everyone. Uh it's a pleasure to be able to do this on behalf of UIDI and thanks for joining. Um so when we are here we feel like an AI organization but it's not wrong we have AI already UID.AI so we can call ourselves an AI first organization. Okay. While sir was talking about uh the ideas of implementation I just want to talk about few initiatives that we have been trying to get started which might be useful for the community at large but just before that I just have a question how many of you are show of hands please if you're use you have used AI to free yourself up maybe write an email okay that's at least 70%age of the audience thanks you had done this you raised your hands because you were intending to free yourself up and how many of you actually became free because of that well that is not even 20%age now this is what the ident is what is the AI paradox we're talking about right we think that we're going to achieve something but at this a flip side to it right u when it comes to identity it's the same problem we actually have a lot of opportunities with AI but we also see a lot of challenges like Sabul Sur just said and it is a share add responsibility that means UIDI might not do everything themselves it has to be done by the ecosystem right and I'm sure that can be done if we do due diligence to any verification any authentication that is done it can be done really well while we are here we keep listening to a lot of ideas related to AI related to address update I'm not able to do this I'm not able to do that it's good but could that actually been done at the you know at the source itself it could be and that's what I think AI implementation in the edge really helps right okay so we want we actually see a lot of companies who are AI companies who want to work closely with us and what we're doing now is make innovation possible from the community itself right and I think it's a very famous word that we Use open innovation. Open innovation is done not by a single organization but done by the ecosystem. And I just want to tell you how we are making it possible. While the core work would be done by UIDI, the other augmented work can be done by the ecosystem. So just a few initiatives we we call it ID AON and ID AON just rebranded as ID AON. Uh recently we did launch an update to our old old Amadada app. We call it the Aadhaar app and I think if most of you have not installed it, please do that. It has a huge benefit to what you'll be able to get once you start using it. And we're not going to explain that today. It is not about the other app. But please feel to reach out to us if you have doubts. The idea we we create an ecosystem called the verification ecosystem or the OBSC's. OVSC stands for offline verification seeking entities. So we used to do authentication all this while. Now we are actually also creating a verification ecosystem to do verification through the Aadhaar app. So when you go to a hotel, people are still asking you to provide your Aadhaar card for identity. You don't probably have to do that in future. You just go scan a QR it becomes like a UPI transaction. You scan a QR, you share the details, you approve the details, you're going to share maybe your name and address and it goes to their back end and it is secured there. There is no paper. It is paperless, right? And this is not just a hottle thing. It could be done in multiple sectors. We did something to bring out the use cases and I think there's a huge opportunity for AI to do a fantastic job if there are a lot more ideas. The other thing for AI community is we always keep saying that we need data and what UI has done is they have put the anonymized data sets completely out into the data.gov gov portal which can be analyzed. You could probably create a get a lot of insights on top of which you can actually build AI solutions. So these two things please keep a lookout. We have um we have shortlisted entities. We also have reward programs associated with it. Maybe this would be a great way to start working in these areas on on using the data hackathons as well as the ideathons. We also have done something very unique which probably no identity provider has done. We've opened u a sandbox into which you can actually through which you can actually get access to the APIs, test your application, integrate it, test it and see whether you can build a new workflow process for your own organization. And this is something that you'll have to also tell us what you need from a sandbox. We have started it. It is open to you. You can register now just go to the sandbox.uida.gov.in and start uh using it. So this is something that we would like you to use and I think in future we would have more challenges in the sandbox. For example, we are looking at contactless biometrics. We're looking at a possible way to kind of uh counter defects. How how do we get the AI community to work with us closely to address defects? We also did one more very very unique thing. It's called Sitha. It's it's called the same scheme for innovation and technology association with ADAR. It is a funded program. We are piloting it today. And this is both the startups as well as the academia. And what is the advantage is if you look at today in India we are lacking an identity technology ecosystem to be developed and it it is something when you see so many people so many AI companies I think it is a huge possibility for companies to add value to identity and it can be done through a program like this and I would request if there's any companies who would like to work closely with us please look at this program there would be lot of new cohorts coming new problem statements ments coming. We have three problem statements just for information. For example, for academia, we have a presentation attack detection. What what research can be done for countering presentation attacks? Please look up what the term means. Contactless fingerprints. We've always been touch- based, right? We've been using fingerprints for a touch-based sensor. But right now, can I use a mobile phone to kind of authenticate? We're looking at building something in addition to the face. We are also looking at face livveness. Very important to make sure that you're alive and you're the person that's authenticating and verifying. So all these challenges are now open. It's not just solved alone by UID. It's solved together. So just want to touch upon this while we build this new app. I would request you to kind kindly um install the app. But we would like to see a lot more use cases coming, lot more innovations coming and lot more secure you know workflows to be created in every sector. So this is what I'd like you to like like you to take back and just leave with a thought that it's a shared responsibility that we have and please work closely with us because now a lot is open for you to work together with us. Yes. >> [music] >> Thank you to all our speakers for that extremely insightful session. It truly opened up new perspectives on Aadhaar, its many dimensions, its evolving architecture and what it offers for the AI ecosystem. Before we go into the next session to give a glimpse into the Aadhaar journey and the tremendous impact it has created across the country, it is my privilege to invite Sri Bhinesesh Kumar IAS CEO Unique identification authority of India to the stage. Sir, may I request you to please take the stage. Thank you Albert. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Uh first of all thank you my colleagues from the technology center at Bangaluru G Tanushi Bharma brother Prasad Sabud and other colleagues uh who have made presentation. I'm sure many of you would be interested in uh some of these activities and apart from what has been explained there is another scheme called SITA which is basic for for scheme for innovation on technology based on Aadhaar. So many of these startups are engaged with us. Academia is associated with us. In fact, we recently had a discussion and our authority chairperson and members are keen to expand the scope of Sitha and include more participation in that and maybe look at doing grant funding as well as equity funding for the startups to look at the innovations that can happen along with the Aadha. Now there are I mean the the topic which we started with the identity paradox actually to me many times Aadhaar has lot of myths and there are many paradoxes. So how many of you are having Aadhaar here? Almost everybody has an Aadhaar. How many of you remember your Aadhaar? Remember your Aadhaar? I'm asking the 12 digits. Oh very large number of people remember it. I'm quite surprised. Pleasantly surprised. Most people think Aadhaar is a card and that's how they treat it and that's unfortunate. It's a paradoxical situation. Aadhaar is not supposed to be a card. Aadhaar is actually only a 12-digit number and that is how it was supposed to be. But over the years it has become a document instead of a number. By law it's still a number, not a document. But it is being mostly used as a document. Wherever you go, people will say, "Show me your Aadhaar." Show me your Aadhaar. On the other hand, people should tell me your Aadhaar. Right? Nobody says, "Tell me your Aadhaar." Everybody says, "Show me your Aadhaar." And most of the people use the Aadhaar in terms of photocopies and they keep your 12digit Aadhaar number. On the other hand, that is not the way it is supposed to be. The identity verification of an individual should should happen only by telling the number and then the requesting entity is able to get the information about you as an individual. They should not retain the number. The number belongs to you and it should retain be retained by you only and nobody else. And there is a risk when you part with your number and give it to somebody else and somebody else now has multiple factors of information about you. They have your Aadhaar number and they also have the demographic information like the name, the date of birth and also your image which makes it actually prone to risk and then there are possibilities of frauds happening and that's why we thought of changing the way Aadhaar is being used and brought the Aadhaar app and through the Aadhaar app when Aadhaar is shared actually Aadhaar is not shared it's only the demographic information which is shared and that is what proves prose the identity. The purpose of having a foundational identity was to prove your identity and do nothing else. So this is one of the first paradoxes or the myths about Aadhaar. The second myth which goes with Aadhaar in most circumstances and recently we found when one of the comment authorities issued a notification telling the students to update their father's name in Aadhaar and let me tell you there is no column for father's name in Aadhaar there is no such column it doesn't contain father's name so some of you might be putting it in the address field saying son of so and so care of so and so in the address field but there is no field because Aadhaar as Sabut was mentioning uh it's it's a huge organization in terms of the numbers but it's a very lean organization in terms of data the total number of fields in Aadhar is about nine that's all so there are three fields of the biometrics the face fingerprints and iris these are the three biometric fields which are captured once never go out of the system, remain securely as one single packet and that is one of the limitations of open and they're kept as one single packet. They're not separated. The iris and fingerprints and the face are never separated from one another. They remain together as one single unit and that's it. That is what makes it secure. And the other four fields which are name, gender, date of birth and address are the demographic information. And two fields are optional and mobile and email. So if you want to provide the mobile and email it, it is up to you. If you don't want to provide, it still works. So the second myth is that Aadhaar has got lot of data. No, it's a very very data lean organization. It works very securely. Biometrics once brought into a system never go out. The law says so the biometrics cannot be shared with anybody under any circumstances and it is used as onetoone authentication. That means if you tell your Aadhaar number to any requesting entity and also give one of the biometrics or maybe mobile OTP. So two attributes on the basis of which identity authentication or verification will happen. The requesting entity makes a request back to back to UIDI. Now this is something which is limiting that if Aadhar authentication has to be happen then the Aadhaar number holder has to provide that information to the requesting entity and then the requesting entity has to make a request back to back to UIDI and this is limiting in terms of numbers. This is limiting in terms of the infrastructure required, the audits, the security and all those challenges and the onboarding process being long and that is why it was very important to uh democratize the identity verification rather than keeping that power with UIDI only all the time and giving authentication from here. We changed the thought process and we said we are going to provide verified credentials to Aadhaar number holders digitally in the Aadhaar app and then they can share these verified credentials to all those entities which are looking for identity verification without their need to coming back to UID. They need not come the offline verification seeking entities need not come to UIDI for any kind of an identity verification. UID has been uh ahead of the technology curve most of the times and right from the beginning has been using artificial intelligence in many ways. Of course with the new large language models and generative AI coming into picture things have changed and the progress has been very very fast. Many of these things have been adopted into the system and you saw through demonstrations including the customer relation management uh the biometric fraud detection and the livveness checking. In fact the the next step could be the legacy document verification. We've seen many of the people who have sent provided us the documents as proof of identity or proof of address have given us document which are really not genuine. Uh they could be either fake or could be fraudulently obtained. So they can be both. The document doesn't exist at all or it exists but has been obtained wrongly and they have submitted those documents. So that's that's a great area where new work can happen and I'm sure many of you would have worked on those sites where you have done um image matchings uh and the image matching softwares through AI use of AI are available and that is one area we are looking at as a potential area for future collaborations. the face livveness uh the in-house development of face authentication uh has been done by UIDI but at the same time we recognize the potential risks in face authentication and people trying to bypass that system and and trying trying to do various kinds of presentation attacks through the videos or through masks and all those things so we engaged with some of the startups they have done uh wonderful work uh but I'm sure there is more scope in this area The world is asking for the face recognition system developed by UIDI and recently we we have opened it up. This is the first time we are opening the SDK of our face RD application to the world and we are saying that okay we will work together and also look at the pads the presentation attack side and work with the startups all those who are in this area to make it far more stronger so that the uh livveness is not manipulated and people are able to use it safely and securely. So some of these areas are extremely important areas and AI is going to play a very very important role in all of these. So whatever we can do inhouse I think for other than that we have to go beyond and look at people who can participate. Today only we received actually a query and interest from the Anusandhan National Research Foundation ANRF. ANRF is keen to do research jointly with UIDI and there there are I think more than 20 odd entities which are already working in the sandbox which was displayed here. Uh the UIDI sandbox which we opened last year in April. It has been existence and many of the authentication user agencies and and the banks and fintexs and biometric uh uh doing biometric entities they all doing research. In fact, many of you perhaps may not be even knowing we have uh roughly two cr anonymized biometric data which we can use for testing any kind of uh application biometric identification system applications ABS applications and in case any of you are working on those areas then you can come back you can bring your models they we will obviously cannot share this data with anybody but this data is available in a sandbox you bring your model into the sandbox You run the model, you see the results, you fine-tune it, take your results and your model back without taking the data away. And that's what is available. I think it's it's a strong platform which is available for people to come and work on. And this is this is unique. I I don't think anybody else in the world will be having that kind of a data to work on. And so if you're working on any of the AI models on the biometrics, you're most welcome. without taking too much of time and because we have the panelists and we are going to hear them. Uh I really want to thank you all for showing your keen interest coming this afternoon to this session joining with us and please do write to us if there is anything that we have not been able to tell you and you still have queries we'll be happy to answer you back. Thank you so much Jane. Thank you so much sir for sharing your thoughts and showing us what Aadhaar could mean for us and what it has in store for us in the coming days. As we continue this conversation on AI and its impact on ID tech and the digital public infrastructure, we now move to what promises to be a highly engaging and thoughtprovoking panel discussion. We are privileged to have with us eminent leaders from across the IDTech and DPI landscape, innovators, policy makers, academicians, and technology builders who are shaping the future of trusted digital identity. Before I invite the panelist, we'll take two minutes for the stage to be set and as soon as it is done, we will be inviting the panelist over. It is my honor to invite our distinguished panelist to the stage. First, may I request our moderator for the day, Mr. Daniel Abadi, head of technology and partnerships at the center of for digital public infrastructure and former under secretary of digital government, government of Argentina to kindly join us on the stage. I would also like to invite the other panelists Shrimati Tanushi Deharma Deputy Director General Technology Development Unique identification authority of India Shri Kedar Kulkarni co-founder and CEO of hypergea professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Jotpur and Shri Varun Chataji co-founder and CTO of seven sense please join the panel and with that now I hand over the session to you Mr. >> Thank you. Hello good afternoon to everyone. Uh first of all congratulation to UAGI uh for showing the progress and showing things actually it's really hard to do things in government and no matter that India is one of the leading countries in this space we need to celebrate that so congratulations again. Um, so I think we're gonna take these next 30 minutes to chat about AI and basically IDE. We got four great panelists, uh, people that really know their things and they're really good on what they do. So I'm going to go directly to the questions and if we have time, we're going to have open to questions. So, Professor Mak uh as AI becomes more powerful both improving authentication and creating risks like deep fakes, how is UI thinking about staying ahead while ensuring trust in the system? So um with respect to UIDI or Aadhaar uh this is this has been in in in in in the discussions not now means defix is like in in 2019 20 2020 onwards that has become more prevalent but uh when we were uh discussing about u establishing such a system in 2009 2010 time frame when no one was talking about being responsible being trustworthy we were actually discussing about how to make this entire system secure, trustworthy, reliable, foolproof, right? So, so, so, so since 2009 2010 time frame, uh we ensured that the systems that we develop or the entire ecosystem that is developed is is reliable. is trustworthy and and that's where the whole design principles uh have been in in Aadhaar uh I would say in in the bloodstream of Aadhaar the uh the whole ecosystem has to that the the way design has been built at the whole ecosystem has to evolve with respect to trustworthy being trustworthy now with respect to the recent threads recent uh uh or the newer threads that are coming in uh Aadhar has been discussing how to actually evolve and some of the things that you have seen over here today and in fact uh uh uh as a committee we are also discussing that how what is the future and in in the future how we will evolve the whole uh um being more trustworthy more secure uh and how to actually follow the seven sutras of being responsible >> that's great and especially on the idea of designing principles from the beginning like designing for scale instead of scaling what you have tests and I'm going to go into honestry but then go into the private sector people say so I heard you talk about you know creating you know models in UDI that work with high accuracy on biometrics to prevent fraud. Can you walk us through that strategy and like to build on top of of what professor had saw? >> Sure. So um right from the beginning um we understood the importance of going paperless meant and presenceless meant being able to identify the person even though they were not there. My previous colleague mentioned that earlier the proof of presence was treated by the eye and your agent but how much can you tr you know trust your agent on source. So slowly becoming paperless and presenceless had to be done through machines and that's how you would achieve scale. So right from the beginning we ensured that the quality of the biometrics that you collect the segmentation what part of the biometrics you are capturing the saving of the same through vectorized formats and thereafter making sure that what you are collecting is live and then making sure what you have collected is dduplicated across a very large gallery and then you identify okay this is the unique person that has come into my system. Later when he comes for authentication, you make sure that over a very high accuracy rate, you can detect him to be live when he places his finger, iris or his face and then ensure with high accuracy and very low false positive rates, making sure that he's identified with himself using his Aadhaar number. So the entire life cycle of capturing livveness detection saving and then matching has completely been done inhouse and made sure with high accuracy rates inclusive simple design and making sure uh fake proof >> that's great and you talk about trust and accuracy and I want to go into now some risks like going to Kedar like across the market you have working like which fraud trend is evolving the fastest right now and why should we be paying attention to it. >> Yeah, I think before I start I think a huge round of applause there are two systems that anywhere you go in the world you always feel proud about. one is Aadhaar UIDI I think everywhere you go in the world you feel proud as an Indian that every other system you feel it's like at least three years or five years behind us and the other is UPI right I think someone was explaining me crypto and you know you can do these instant transactions and all have you come to India you can do a 10 rupee transaction and and you don't get charged anything um so I think we are I think leading the world in terms of digital public infrastructure a Big credit to all people here. Hyperverge works with financial services organizations across the world. Uh in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, uh US. One of the things that we see is usually fraud is something that starts in one part of the world and slowly we see it moving to other parts of the world. Deep fake currently is the biggest u fraud movement that we see. We saw it start in Indonesia about two years back. We work very closely with Grab and some entities there and we started seeing these attacks there. We started building for it and now we start seeing attacks in India. I really like to spend a lot of time uh with these teams because we want to be as close to the user. So recently with one of the largest private banks, we saw this very interesting case where a person has taken a perfect picture. He's smiling and everything is good and it looks like he has taken it with his front camera but then when you closely watch the picture both his hands are behind him. So you're like how is he taking a front pick with the because the only way you are allowed to go forward is when you can use the front camera of your cell phone. So how is he using the front camera of a cell phone and having both his hands at the back. So these are the kind of uh interesting cases that we see. the other kind of frauds that we are now starting to see in India. Um so in any crime usually you know we say hey it's not the outsiders uh family has an equal role to play in crimes right a lot of times we believe crimes happen with people where an outsider is involved so this is a classic example the wife would be sleeping and the husband needs a loan and he doesn't want to tell her he needs a loan but you know very quickly he would go put her Aadhaar number and just take a picture of her or she might be cooking and he would just say just look at this for one minute I just need you know I'm doing some application. So her intention is not to get a loan but she ends up being the person who ends up uh on whose name on whose credit rating the loan happens right. So we usually see these trends for some reason we see them emerging in Southeast Asia a lot more and then moving to places like India. The other funny thing that I see with financial services organizations, right? I think Indian marriages are extremely famous, right? We have big fat Indian weddings and it always goes two ways, right? Either you have a big budget in mind and then you share it with your parents and who if they are financing it eventually a lot of things get cut down or it goes the other way around. You start with a small project and it goes beyond size. Um so one of the common thre threads that we observe is organizations start with I need all protection and usually this protection in the AI world if you think about there is no one engine that is preventing fraud right um like a Mosart Vienna orchestra where there are 30 people playing in case of hyperverge we have about 40 engines that are working in the background to prevent frauds right like livveness presentation attacks deep fakes quality checks checks that we mentioned document forgery checks. So there are 40 engines that are working in the background and every time we call each one of them it costs us. So we give you know we can give full protection at this price. And usually people say this is all good but I don't think I need all this protection. I need I can pay you only so much. So we say if you can pay me only so much in your marriage only five people can play. You can't have 35 people playing. And it gets started like that. But eventually in another month's time, 6 months time, we are sitting with the fraud team. They are saying how can hyperverge pass all of these cases. All of these are frauds. How did you allow this to happen? We said see all of these checks we have recommended. These are the six emails that we have sent you saying please enable them. You have not enabled them. Then the fraud team says you know what I'm going to make the business and procurement team enable all of this. So eventually it all gets enabled and the whole orchestra plays and the wedding goes well. But but that's the pattern that we see. So the message on fraud to organizations is like in a defense situation, right? We don't start preparing once the attack happens. We can prepare, we should have it tested. Maybe we are not rolling it out full scale, but we should have them ready to fire, right? At any point if we need them to fire, we should have all our systems ready to fire. So that's the key message on fraud that I've seen. >> Yeah. Perfect. And it's super interesting how a trend it's a like deep fake is two years now in time. It's not it's like the last month. So and moving now into Barun on like with all the benefits of biometrics as an enabler for digital identities for identity systems like what are some of the challenges around using biometrics for identity proofing like how do you envision this? >> Yeah. So I'm coming at this from a slightly different angle. Um my startup seven sense is dealing with privacy enhancing technologies and while we do deal with biometrics our angle is to enable to keep biometrics as an enabler but still protect the biometrics. So the biggest challenge is I I think maybe I can talk about three challenges. So the first challenge is that biometrics are not revocable or renewable. Right? If you have your fingerprint, you have your face, you have your iris, you cannot change it, right? So while there are stringent protections that organizations like UIDI have around that data, it is still a risk inherent risk that despite all the protections, despite all the security, there is still a risk that if that data is lost, it can never be regained again. It cannot be changed. You cannot change your face. You cannot change your fingerprint. Ideally, you would want to ideally you would want your biometrics to serve just like a password. So, if I want if my password is compromised, I can change my password. But I can't change my biometrics. So, this is one core challenge and it is not insurmountable. As a matter of fact, there are standards that are out there. There are organizations that are working in this area in this area of privacy enhancing technologies where you have something known as a renewable biometric reference. So instead of a biometric reference being a template being a feature vector, you have a renewable biometric reference where you take the biometric and you add some entropy to it and you create a representation which is not biometric. So in our case of course in in the case of privacy enhancing technologies you can have biometric derived representations or you can have completely different representations. So in in the case of seven sense we mold or rather we operate at the se intersection of machine learning cryptography and biometrics. So face is our primary factor though we can also um protect other biometric factors with the face. Um and what we do is we derive a key from the face and we encrypt your PII with it and then at the point of verification if you can derive the key to decrypt it then through the act of decryption you are verified. So this is uh bringing together biometrics, cryptography and machine learning to create this renewable biometric system which protects biometric templates yet still enables the system to use biometrics. The second one that I see the challenge is that with privacy legislation like the DPDPA and like we've had with GDPR and PDPA in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, there is always a purpose limitation around the collection of biometrics, right? or organizations like UIDI have the Aadhaar Act under which they operate and biometric data is always collected for very specific purposes. For example, in the Aadhar act it is for two specific purposes. One is for the creation of the Aadhaar and the other one is for the verification of the Aadhaar and therefore that biometric data is sacrosanked. It lives within the central identity data repository. It is never allowed to go outside. But with privacy-enhancing technologies, that same biometric data can be used to enable organizations to interact with that biometric data as an enabler, but still without having access to the direct biometric data. So the my biometric data for hyperge will be different. My biometric data for IIT will be different, for PAN will be different, for banks will be different. And each of these will be able to verify me with my biometrics without touching my biometrics. And of course, the the basic attributes have been already enabled in in the Aadhaar app where now I can present my verifiable credential to these organizations. However, the act of verifying um via biometrics also is also enabled with offline verification seeking entities. Now but there are other cases for example we worked in rural India where one is to1 verification was not feasible for attendance taking because there are 50 people there are 10 people that you need to take the attendance for and if you go and say what is your Aadhaar number I want to take your picture okay you are verified you enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enter so 1 is to n is obviously not within the mandate of Aadhaar but once you have that one is to1 verification with Aadhaar privacy enhancing technologies like ours can enable even one is to end in certain circumstances. So I think I was going to speak about three challenges but I think I'll stop with just two because I've taken up a lot of time and I'll pass it back to Dan. >> Thank you. I think that's super interesting and I want to keep in the biometrics part and go come back to you Dennis on like you've been working a lot on biometrics due to application. how how you envision this as a DPI. So um what we have done over the years is we have partnered with various organizations to make sure that the technology has not been limited to UID uh with the collaboration with MOSIP uh with collaboration with many other countries who are we see the Kenyan delegation right here um and many more countries um even today our CEO had to step out because he had a meeting with Bolivia in the morning he has hosted vice president of socials And we have been leading the global south and not just that uh developing countries and developed countries alike and explaining to them and handholding them to adopt this technology. So that consultative approach and collaborative approach has always been there. In terms of the technology, we have always been an open house o open-source house and we made sure that the technologies that we adopted were from the community and brought back to the community. U what where we are going now is like our CEO mentioned in his previous talk that um some of the technologies were very core to private companies. In fact, UIDI itself today uses three vendors to use um the dduplication process. But we have now the capability of doing it inhouse and we have got very good results. Um at least over the 18 plus population we have accuracies much better than the best of the companies. We are now trying to expand that model and make sure that for the use cases of UIDI where we collect biometrics above five years of age it it expands at the same scale and better. Uh while we are in that process we are consulting with uh we want to reach out to companies who can become u uh the conduits or help us in consulting with various other countries who want to adopt this technology. Open source it but at the same time give the support for adoption. uh if required for uh uh you know uh technology diffusion as we call it. So we're hoping that we'll be able to take it out to the world the AIS as we call it and use it as a DPI right out of India's uh stack. >> Thank you. So keeping I'm going to go into now to the to professor Maya and then go like I'm going keeping into other and then going more to the industry view. So running a government service it's like critical infrastructure like once you're live like you deliver services to citizens you cannot have you cannot have a shutdown because people can you know don't access to services so how do you work in UDI on like to approach fairness inclusion and responsible governance as you include AI into the authentication process like how do You embed the safeguards now that AI has come to like enhance authentication let's say that way we have to understand now that UIDI has a 15 more than 15 years of history now and when I say history it's like memory right we have we have a lot of uh experience um and and I'll actually get to quot uh an interesting example where when again 2019 9 2010 time frame. Uh we were involved when we were doing the P and when we realized that when we reached to a particular state the face quality match was not working because the the the way the quality thresholds were set they were set for a particular sub ggeography within India. But when we reach to the another state the quality thresholds are like rejecting all the faces and given as as CEO mentioned Burji mentioned that all the three biometric modalities are packed together. If one is rejected the entire packet is rejected. So we had to actually go back to the field and to figure out what what is wrong what went wrong. So so initially we set the thresholds way too high the quality parameters way too high. when then when then we looked at the parameters when we looked at all the values from that state what was wrong we adjusted it and and these kinds of adjustments would have happened over the years in UIDI across different modalities different application domains so it's a huge amount of corpus of knowledge that UI has so now and and when we talk about artificial intelligence growth of artificial intelligence we have to also understand that AI use of AI in biometrics and Aadhaar as a whole would would be incomplete if we don't use this knowledge right and that's where this whole open ecosystem that Aadhaar has is very important to to uh take a look at what learnings Aadhaar has like collected over the years has solved so many problems uh and and like we all are accessing Aadhaar on a day in dayout basis like millions of uh um uh transactions through Aadhaar is happening So, so this whole ecosystem has now so much knowledge that the domain contextdriven artificial intelligence can really take the Aadhaar to the next step and that's what we are actually looking at how what is the future of Aadhaar and how we go forward and that's where this whole knowledge base would be very very useful >> great >> and I just want to come in here um >> so like uh professor Mank was mentioning um when we train our models the we have the advantage of temporal shifts the person has um joined uh UIDI as a 5-year-old kid over next 15 years he has done his biometric updates and we know exactly how his face progresses so when UIDI says that I can match faces over years of uh you know person's aging we actually mean it because nobody else will have a progression of a person from 5 to 15 because We've been functional for 15 years and again at 15 to 30 and therefore in fact irrespective of that we use face much more reliably than fingers and irises because they age much more um uh faster in terms of matching uh comparison. So even though we use all the three parameters together but face has a very high um uh you know uh matching rate even over the years. In fact for elderly the fingers deteriorate but their face is very very matchable till they become you know uh 1999. >> Totally agree. I I always joke around with promote when I say I come from a country that has dig identity ID like forever but for me like it's 45 million people is like your sandbox [laughter] >> so that's like our testing yeah >> so yeah so I will talk about that but going into the knowledge of the ecosystem so going to get our um what have you seen consistently driving meaningful conversion gains without materially will be increasing the the risk of fraud like yeah I think great question if we are extremely strict no user will go through and if we are extremely lenient we will convert a lot of users but a lot of them would be fraud so it's a balance the one thing I always feel right if you see the ecosystem we have the end user who is trying to open an account or who is trying to get access to some financial service then we have the regulated entity then we have a tech company which could be like hyperverge we have government of India we have regulator and then we also have the digital public infrastructure so it's a so many stakeholders are involved in this process and every stakeholder is bringing some important boundary conditions the regulator is bringing boundary conditions on fraud etc etc something thing that I observed right when we are a startup we are sitting out of client's office we are seeing every application and we are solving every problem somewhere as you have 10 clients you know you start sitting out of your office more when you have 50 clients then you are a lot of times you are just looking at excel sheets and telling the board this is the number this quarter that is the number that quarter so even the role I play I felt at a certain scale you are managing so many internal problems that we somehow forget whom do we serve and if we calmly look at it whom do we all serve we finally serve that end user the common Indian who is trying to avail the services right when there are so many stakeholders it's very difficult to keep a track that that's the person we are serving so when I say conversion rate right conversion rate for a registered entity may mean that if we improve it by 1% their topline increases by like a million dollars right for someone like a midsize NBFC may increase by a million dollars. But if we think of it from a end user's perspective, right, it could be a a pensioner who is sitting at the home. It could be someone who is uh extremely excited that they will get onto a brokerage and they will start their trading right now in a tier three. So it is all of these people that we are serving. My biggest lesson has been um every week spend time with whom do you serve, right? So the rule for me breaks down to if I am meeting because I can't directly meet the customer. I can't run around on the road and say who is doing other authentication I need to check it or who is doing KYC and I need to sit with you. But one easy way to do it is at least sit out of offices of banks, NBFCs, brokerages and look at data right personally look at data not what my team is telling me not what their team is telling me just calmly looking at data seeing hey what's the problem what are the people who are the people who are stuck in the queue right now and I think the amount of insights that gives where I see the customer facing problems directly we all are people who can then say if this is a problem for this customer who else is a problem for and we can go out there and solve it. Um so every time I personally I feel I spend time on conversion rate I'm helping that Indian who is doing uh onboarding or the Southeast Asian who is doing onboarding who doesn't have the voice to reach me directly perfect and that's you give me so you mentioned KYC which is now your client and I want to go to Barun because I was reading previous to the session defining the question with all of you like you So I going to talk about agents that we haven't mentioned in this session but now we are like in an agent world and we're going into the agents world like how do you see like delegation of identity and know your agent beside know your clients like how how we going to navigate this? So this is a I mean this is a very future-looking sort of question because we have just started using agentic AI uh this year we already you even ask seven sense we started building code using agents right so the question is like when an agent an AI agent is acting on your behalf for in the example of code for example when you're checking in it's your identity that is checking in that code. Ostensibly that code is written by you. So I'm just using this technical example but as agentic use becomes more prevalent agents will do more right they will act on your behalf to open bank accounts. They will act on your behalf to write emails and this is coming right I mean we have to pay attention to it now. So if an agent is acting on your behalf then the agent has to somehow represent you and today I have an identity as an Aadhaar holder but now if I have agents agentic AI um which is opening a bank account for me which is booking my travels for me I don't want to share my Aadhaar number through that agent maybe right and how does that agent get authenticated and that agent tomorrow may spawn even more agents. So again going back to the technical example, I have personally used a team of agents where I had one team lead, one agent acting as a UIUX developer, one agent acting as an Android developer, one agent acting as an iOS developer and I said here are my specs go write the software and this entire software which would have taken about six months to develop took about maybe two hours and from the UI UX iOS app, Android app um back end, front end, everything was done in two hours. It would have taken four to six months and this is going to become even more pervasive in other industries. Just now the technology industry is early as an early adopter but this will happen. This is coming. So how does the delegation of identity work right? I have an Aadhaar number or I have some root of trust and how do I say that okay you are my agent and you can act on my behalf to open a bank account. How does the bank trust that um identity? So for this you need a chain of trust and again I will go back a little bit to what seven sense does which is bringing um machine learning and cryptography together. So the internet does this really well. you have certificate authorities those are the root of trust. So even if you like have a company in India or have bid for an government tender you actually get this hardware security module which contains your private key. Now you use this private key to sign something and you also with this private key you get a digital certificate. So this is exactly how the internet also works. their certificate authorities they will say okay hyperverge.com belongs to such and such ident uh registered entity we have verified the entity therefore we can give you an SSL certificate for hyperverge.com and thereafter when I interact with hyperverge.com I can verify that certificate or rather my browser verifies that certificate and now if you see that there is a delegation of identity already happening where you got maybe the hyperge certificate from an organization like um I don't know digert or entrust and they did that initial verification and then they gave you that certificate and there can be some intermediary uh certificate authorities in this chain as well. So the same technology can apply for agents as well where you have the root certificate um which is the Aadhaar certificate which issues me my identity certificate and I issue my agent an identity certificate and that agent can go and issue sub agents identity certificates and this entire chain of trust is verifiable through cryptography. Another interesting thing that this brings into the fray is something that is being overlooked at the moment and it will become increasingly important over the next 10 to 20 years which is postquantum cryptography. So today's identity systems the cryptography they are using is often RSA or elliptic curve or like basically these are technologies that are broken by advanced quantum computers by something known as shores algorithm. So if you in the future if you have a public key and a sufficiently powerful quantum computer from the public key you will be able to derive a private key. So all cryptography is broken in the future. So what are organizations do rather let me not say organizations what are states doing? I mean behind the scenes every state has some espionage unit. States are harnessing data, right? China is looking at data, US is looking at data. Just they're capturing the data. They can't decrypt it right now. Your bank transactions that are happening, everything that every interaction that you have today is being recorded somewhere. And that data will become plain text data in maybe 10 or 20 years. So this is another important theme that ID systems need to pick up is to bring in postquantum cryptography into the mix. Your verifiable credential that resides in the Aadhaar act uh Aadhaar app sorry will be signed by a traditional algorithm today but NIST has already standardized a few algorithms. NIST is the National Institute of Standards Technology USA. They have already certified and standardized a few algorithms such as module latis key encapsulation mechanism, module latis digital signing algorithm. These are already standards and they can be adopted today and seven sense is also working with the internet engineering task force to define the standards of these certificates. But in the case of seven sense, what is unique is that these certificates that I'm talking about contain a public key that is derived from a face. So now we have all the benefits of public key infrastructure from document signing from transaction au authentication from passwordless login you have all the applications that are available on the internet that rely on cryptography but now we bring biometrics into the fray and all of those transactions signing encryption decryption passwordless login are all can all use your face as an authentication factor and use postquantum cryptography in the chain of trust. >> Thank you. Um it's I'm I'm curious. I'm conscious about time. I think we have passed the time. I want to thank our great panelists like a great vision from the public sector from the private sector. So big round of applause for them and thank you so much. Dan, can I add something as a closing comment? >> Uh, yes, please. >> Okay, so for all of us, I think >> you got one minute. >> Yeah, I take 30 seconds. Sorry for the previous long runs. I think the first I have a 3 and a half year old and I think even when she was very small, maybe 6 months or a year old, midnight, it's 2 am, 2 am, 3:00 a.m., she recognizes her mother even without opening her eyes, right? As in at night she wakes up, drinks milk >> and sleeps off. >> And imagine a day when your mother doesn't recognize you, right? You'll be horrified, right? Like because that's one person you expect. No matter who else doesn't recognize you, your mom should recognize you. >> The Alzheimer panel, it's in the other pavilion. Let's let's go with that. >> No, I feel uh every time you know a user is not recognized, they're a legitimate user and they are facing friction with identity of any kind, right? you want to open account something like that in a way it's like your mother not recognizing you in India we call India as bhat mata so we call it a mother so I think the friction if we can make it we should constantly be on a mission to reduce the friction I think mother India should always recognize her kids >> great thank you I think it's yeah I think the narrative is basically how other creating an ecosystem where we can have innovators creating services and all this. But again, congrats to the heart. I know you do it so simple and tell it so simple and beautiful and smart, but just like 15 years of hard work and so thank you all and thank you all. >> Thank you everyone for being a part of this. Thank you. >> Thank you. Thank you so much to our esteemed panelist and the distinguished panel uh for enriching us with that you know insightful session. As a token of our appreciation, I request pan ma'am to please hand the uh metos from UIDA to our distinguished panel. I think that's a good idea. Thank you so much once again. Uh, can I request the panels just come forward for a group photo? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you once again to all the speakers, to the panel, to all of you who have joined here. We look shape the next phase of the trusted digital identity in India. Thank you and have a wonderful evening ahead. >> [music] [music] [music]
