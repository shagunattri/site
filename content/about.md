ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Shagun. This site serves as my digital notebook and library where I share insights from my professional life, technical explorations, book reviews, and guides.

Currently, I'm a Product Manager at ArmorCode, focusing on ASPM and RBVM within the B2B cybersecurity space. I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and human psychology, applying these insights to build better, more secure products. 

My interest in security extends beyond my day job; on this site, I frequently delve into topics ranging from defensive best practices and privacy - 
- [Protecting Your Digital Self](blog/protecting_your_digital_self)
- [Password Breaches](blog/passwordbreaches)

to the technical details of security tools and concepts 

- [Metasploit](blog/metasploit),
- [CTFs](blog/c4ptur3-th3-fl4g),
- [Network Security](blog/networksecurity).

While my primary focus is product strategy, I enjoy diving into the technical weeds. I'm comfortable in Linux environments (having previously run Arch Linux, now primarily on macOS) and enjoy working with tools like Docker [Docker Architecture](blog/dockerarchitechture), [Containerization](blog/containerization), Git [VCS](blog/vcs), [Vim](blog/vim), and the command line [Shell Scripting](blog/shellscripting), [Shell](blog/shell). 

You'll find posts here sharing tips, configurations [My Setup](blog/setup), and explorations of these technologies. My projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/shagunattri).

As an avid reader ([Books Read](blog/Books), [Reading Lists](blog/wutiread010123)), I also share my thoughts on books I've found insightful, particularly around technology, product, and business.
