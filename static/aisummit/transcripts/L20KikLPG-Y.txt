downstairs. Think of it as almost your personal research tool. Any of you can download it. Uh you can add all your sources and it's sort of your brain, right? It is your assistance. It completely private. It has multiformat capabilities and has changed uh the way people think about the information that they have. Reporters constantly tell us, "Oh my god, what took us eight hours to decode now is taking us five minutes." Right? Magical tool. Gemini brings the outside inside, right? So if you want to know more about the market around you, best practices, the way X is thinking about something, Y is thinking about something, what already exists in the market outside, it really is a phenomenal analyst in that sense. And finally, AI studio is, you know, in in one of the earlier um startup panels, somebody said, you know, you always look for a tech co-founder. You couldn't come up with a startup unless you had a tech co-founder. This is really your tech co-founder, right? He this AI studio is your CTO, right? So each and every one of you can build apps, uh publish dashboards, create websites very very quickly in the way that you want it to be. Um you know what people say is al always better testimony than what I tell you. But again here um two bits that I would uh really like to draw your skills uh sorry attention to. You know how do we think about AI responsibly and how do we be open to what it can do for us but still be very cognizant of the checks and balances that we need to keep on place. I think the that it helped us rethink our policy moving from restrictive to a framework that enables us to utilize its creative power in a responsible way. I think this is one of my most favorite quotes coming out of the program. Um I I'll stop with this and I'll let you read it, but sufface to say that um it is for us a very empowering and transformational moment. We cannot make full use of this moment without partners like the Indian Institute of Mascom our academic partner without the ecosystem and without individual creators who embrace these tools in the way that they tell stories. Storytelling has completely um you know been the the distribution lines are getting redrawn. Each of you is a creator and a storyteller and we hope that this session going forward will really uh spark ideas, unleash creativity, give you ways in which you might if you had um you know trepidation towards any particular format or way of thinking this will perhaps uh also make you more enthusiastic about new ways. Um with that I'm going to hand over to Gail um who uh you know has an extremely interesting global view of the way these things work. Uh she's been in Google for many years and before that she was with uh Meta as well. So she has a platform approach that I'm really looking forward. So thank you Durgga. That was a fantastic introduction to what is definitely a critical conversation about the future of journalism, the future of news that and technology that we're going to be having uh today. I am unbelievably excited to be here. There is nowhere in the world like in India that brings energy and excitement when we're talking about technology. I really love the fact that I'm looking at a sea of faces who are not the same age as me. So, thank you all for being here and thank you for helping us all learn. A particular welcome to our esteemed guests um and also to all of the journalists, the publishers and the editors um in this room. You are the very heart of the Indian news industry and we're really really happy that you're here with us today. So we are here today because we are seeing um you know I sit in Mountain View and you can hear from my accent I'm not American I'm European but I really am thinking about this as Dura said through a global lens. So what we are seeing is that globally the way that people engage with information is changing. It's changing radically. We're seeing a fundamental shift in the type of uh ways that people um assume and understand information. Um everywhere in the world there is a movement away from long form text towards more immersive videos to audio and people are increasingly looking at authentic content not just from authoritative news sources but from creators and from voices that they feel really represents them. And no more There's nowhere in the world that you see that evolution as quickly and as excitingly as you see it in India. So whether it's about audio, whether it's about video, whether it's about different languages or just the vast way that people are putting content online, India is really leading the world. And in Google, we see this not as a challenge, but we see it as an opportunity. How can we evolve with you? And we're adapting our products at this moment to meet this moment. So yes, we are we continue to display top news stories from trusted publishers, but we're also displaying those right alongside what creators are saying about a story. And we're building our products and we'll continue to build our products in a way that features more videos and results and ensuring that we can support that rich diversity of languages that exist in this fantastic country. But that evolution isn't possible unless we're doing it in a way that we are working together. So Google cannot exist without the vibrant and evolving ecosystem that you have built right here in India. And we truly truly value that partnership. It's a core part, you heard from Dura, it's a core part of how we make sure that we are building a product that works for people and that's why we launched things like preferred sources which enable people to choose the sources that they get their news from. So we've had some fantastic conversations and we're thrilled to have worked with partners like the Hindustan Times, The Hindu, the Manorama online, Quint, The Prince, Jagran, Times of India, NDTV, Network 18, ABP um to implement this in India. and we're committed to continuing to evolve our efforts um to make sure that we can also give those smaller those local voices that are the bedrock um of community so that we can also make sure that they are featuring because we know that that's what people want. So we're here to talk about generative AI and we know that this is exactly as Dura has said is this really powerful tool um that is really going to help us collectively rewrite the landscape and when we connect with these tools we and look at how they can best serve India how they can best serve you in this room we know that the potential is immense so whether that's about empowering journalists and creators to meet the demand for new format whether Whether it's helping them do things quicker in a way that makes more sense to them or whether it's about ensuring that they can do it in lots of different formats, we want to make sure that AI is about empowering all of you. And we know that that isn't just about getting the message out there. We also know that that is um transforming and or that is also showing up in the economic potential that generative AI has for the for the creator sector. There is a report out um yesterday from public first that talks about what AI could mean for the EI corrective center. So and let me give you some numbers. So they believe that before 2035 the economic potential could exceed 240 billion rupees and we're already seeing this in our AI skills academy where journalists as Rupa said um as Derma said sorry from over 110 newsrooms are saving on average more than eight hours a week by using AI tools. And we also know that AI translation can really help a regional um journalist story reach um reach a national audience and that's where the potential for impact really is growing and this journey is one that we absolutely all have to take together. We are here because we want to be part of it and we want to be working with you to be part of that. And so working together as technology companies, as journalists, as publishers, as platforms, and as policy makers, we believe that in working in partnership, we can absolutely continue to build this incredible, vibrant, inclusive and sustainable future for Indian youth. Thank you very much. Thank you, Gail. Um, you know, the way we bring a lot of this together, um, in terms of the products we take to market, um, the way we work with publishers and the evolution of those products, I think Gail is at the intersection of, um, the way we operate and, uh, it's it's fantastic to see your excitement about India as well and spending the last few days with you. Um, it's with great pleasure that I uh want to call on stage Shri Prabad uh who is the addition additional secretary for the ministry of information and broadcasting. Um sir, you know we we we really uh are looking forward to your thoughts across partnering and collaborating in general uh your view on the responsible parts of AI. um and and any I think uh messages you have to this ecosystem in what is such a fundamental and defining moment. Sir, please join us on stage um and give us some good afternoon distinguished delegates, speakers, ladies, gentlemen. First of all, I thank uh Miss Dura Ragunat and uh Miss Gail Kent for setting the stage for today's discussion. Uh very relevant topic and uh the way people are standing I'm I'm really I I did not expect this topic will be such a hit, super hit. Uh as you have rightly articulated the AI moment offers an unprecedented opportunity to the global south. India is on the cusp of taking a leap. I'm proud to affirm that India is positioned to lead this transformation. its capabilities create new possibilities for newsrooms and content creators where AI can be a strategic tool for growth enabled by right training and skilling. So capacity building is critical to creativity and use of AI. um with rapid advancement in technology in new tools every day we are uh hearing about something new coming up so getting skilled upskilled is must and in this context uh I'm uh grateful to Google news initiatives and IMC I commend them and their leaderships for organizing this very successful program where uh editors from various media houses were given training immersive training uh over spread over 10 to 12 weeks I think with the hands-on guidance and um mentorship so and the response as you saw as you saw was tremendous 100% of the participants recommend the course for their peers so this uh speaks a volumes about this course and its design. I commend uh for the thoughtful design of the program and the holistic approach from in-person immersion and weekly online sessions to dedicated mentoring. The partnership is a testament to a principle I have long advocated for collaboration over competition. Uh I commend Google's efforts and partnership with the premier media training institute u uh I encourage all tech platforms news and media houses and academic institutions to collaborate more on similar lines. I look forward to this. U AI is transforming journalism making it faster, cheaper. Use of AI accelerates the rate of production and reduces costs. It reduces human labor involved in development of new stories. AI can be laid can be used to analyze metadata, summarize voluminous reports, translate, transcribe. For example, Simma 4 has used it to make a multi-source breaking news feed. The AI platform searches news sources across the globe across different languages and then the human editor decides what is going to be the next breaking news. Similarly, some media houses are using uh AI tools that can predict trending stories that their journalist should work on. AI is also used to proofread, draft headlines, come up with outlines, thus assisting journalists. AI tools are also being developed to detect deep fakes fakes. AI has the capability of personalizing news feed of a user based on the user's reading preferences. The level of personalization effects impacts user engagement on the news apps. Generative graphic engines also assist newsroom in converting their news stories into visual stories and for data reporting using graphs personalizing them for individual users. For example, PTI is employing a AI tools for visual storytelling. PTI's integrated AI powered tools are generating infographics 12 times faster than the previous methods. It is almost available realtime basis. uh all infographics AI generated visual formats also significantly enhance engagement on social media with a reported increase of 566%. Akashwani under Prasar Bharti is also using AI. For example, manibat program is being translated real time using AI into 24 languages and broadcasted simultaneously. Uh I shall now propose a practical trust architecture for AI in newsrooms. What does AI responsible AI look like in in practice? It is not one rule. It is a system, a trust architecture. Disclose where it matters. Audiences should know when AI materially shaped content, especially if it generated text, images, audio in a way that could affect interpretation. Human oversight as a non-negotiable editorial responsibility cannot be outsourced to a model, any AI model. AI can assist. AI may be used to assist. It cannot approve the final thing. Verification protocols for AI assisted outputs. The stronger the claim, the stronger the check required. Newsroom should treat AI drafts as unverified working papers, not publishable material. They should run through it, check it carefully. Clear accountability lines. If AI is used, every story still needs an accountable editor and a responsible institution behind it. Data discipline, what your you input matters. Privacy, source protection and security must be embedded. AI convenience cannot become a pathway to compromising sensitive journalistic material. Government is bound is uh is committed to enable innovation protecting the information ecosystem. From a public policy perspective, we want an environment where AI strengthens not destabilizes the information ecosystem. This means that we encourage responsible innovation and practical deployments that demonstrabably improve accuracy and inclusion of reporting. Promoting standards and best practices that the ecosystem can internalize especially on transparency, provenence and accountability. building capacity, training journalists, editors and educators because literacy is safety measure. Supporting research and collaboration so that India's newsrooms, realities, languages, misinformation patterns and public needs are reflected in solutions. I will call upon all to move from tools to trust. I will uh let let it be clear to Google to news organizations to institutions that train our journalists. Move from tools to trusts. Invest not only in capability but in responsibility in responsible capability. Newsroom ready AI that is transparent, auditable and safer by design. Help build practical standards for disclosure and provenence. support training that is not a one-time workshop but a continuing program that creates a community of practice across Indian languages and newsroom contexts and ensure that innovation does not weaken the fundamentals of journalism source protection privacy editorial independence and accountability to media houses I would say treat AI as a professional instrument, not as a shortcut. Adopt AI where it strengthens reporting, translation, transcription, retrieval, verification, support, but never allow it to become a substitute for editorial judgment. Put in place a simple enforcable newsroom playbook. What can be automated? What can be reviewed? What must always be independently verified? and who is accountable for each step. Make disclosure a habit where it matters. Invest in your people because the competitive advantage in the AI age will not be speed. It will be credibility. In the coming years, the most valuable newsroom will not be the one that publishes first. It will be the one that remains credible when the information environment is under stress. AI can help with speed, access and capability, but only if we design it around trust. If we do this together, India can set a global benchmark, a journalist ecosystem that uses AI to expand reach and capability while strengthening trust and accountability. While use of AI for optim for optimization is inevitable as it enhances speed pro efficiency quality it has its limitations as it is as of now basically working on available data sets. Hence human oversight is a must. As of now, I would request all concerned to use AI safely and responsibly in order to retain trust of public in at large. Uh to conclude, I look forward to the flash talks and the discussions that follows. I encourage everyone to focus on one question. What are the real implementable practices that let AI improve journalism without weakening accountability? Thank you. Thank you for providing this support. >> Thank you uh Shri Prabat. Um I think sobering but hugely encouraging. uh we value the openness and the enthusiasm around AI tooling but completely uh take your point about transitioning from tooling to trust and thinking deeply about it. Um thank you that's that's definitely a line that's going to stay with me sir. Um let me invite on state survi to introduce uh you know the exciting part of this session which is our flash talks. Thank you. Thank you Dura. Hello everyone. Uh my name is Sudi Malik and I'm also part of the news partnerships team at Google in India. For our next segment uh we will hear from Google partners, industry pioneers and experts and AI skills academy participants on how they've been utilizing and leveraging the power of AI in their newsrooms to boost productivity, efficiency and also user engagement. And for this segment we have a very diverse set of speakers who have joined us for the day today. um you know right from uh you know the digital wing of Jagran new Jagran media which is the largest uh you know Hindi daily to the press of India which is the biggest wire service uh mint which is a leading financial and business daily uh to my which is a website dedicated to sports coverage and analytics and also uh you know our esteemed partners from the team at IMC who've been our partner for this AI skilling you know program that we mentioned uh and they will take us through what their unique challenges in each one of their work areas are and how they've been able to use some of our uh you know training material courses and tools to be able to solve real problems for them uh you know in their day-to-day life. Um our first speaker for the day um is Raja Shapad who's the uh editor-inchief of Jagran new media. Uh Raju G leads the digital wing of Jagran uh you know daily Hindi widely read in very many states and he will come and talk about how his newsroom has integrated AI into their ops to increase efficiency and also scale uh you know language and local reportage.

Thank you. >> Thank you Raj. >> Thank you Rajes G. Um infographics which makes news pieces or very text heavy things more digestible personal favorite and I'm sure personal favorites of the session. Uh with that we'll move on to the next speaker um who is uh you know Pratush Shanjan from the team at PDI. Pratush heads uh the digital services and AI integration department at the press of India which is the largest wire services uh you know hundreds of stories every day bureaus across the country very unique challenges uh but Pratush will talk about how they've been using you know AI to streamline their workflows uh create you know more text and different formats out of you know very many files of data that they get. Uh with that I'd like to invite Pratish on stage. Pratish welcome. >> Thank you Suri. Thank you Da. Thank you team Google and uh thank you uh everyone here. Uh hello from uh first test of India India's uh most credible old and largest uh huge agency and uh sir Prahad Sri Prahas was talking about trust. So trust is there in our name press trust of India. So uh I'll talk about uh how I'll quickly go to the slides and I'll talk about how we are implementing or have started implementing uh different AI tools in our newsroom. When we say newsroom that doesn't mean that uh there's one place and we just started using one tool and everything started happening. It's not like that. If you know how to how a newsroom works. Uh I mean news the information flows from one side to another side and in between between these two sides multiple layers are there multiple cross checks are there multiple editorial checks are there. So we need to finalize and we need to decide at what point in time what kind of tools are there to help us to save our time because the basic mantra of air tools is to save your time the save journalist time so that they can do productive and quality work. That's the that's the bottom line. So let's move to the slides. So I'll talk about first PTI. So you know PTI is started in 49 and PTI photos we started as a new service which is uh from 1987 we started PTI videos from 2022 and we started PTI facteck in 2022 uh just before the Loki elections I had a thought and discussion with my CEO and at chief Mr. Vijay Jooshi that we should do something on the basis of AI uh production and AI with the help of AI tools. So we started working on this kind of uh uh production uh with the help of the basic AI tools but the things changed. This was the like very first production what we did from our PTI infographic desk that we launched just before the Loki election. This was a very basic thing. Then the turnaround happened and the change happened in PTI newsroom because uh one of my team members Mr. Deepak became the part of this uh GNI data journalism lab and this program that ran that was there for I think more than two months and that changed completely how PTI newsroom started thinking about data and production production of data stories in a completely new visual telling uh for format and framework. So that was that and then AI tools we started using in different workflows like you can see on the screen that there are multiple layers are there and during those multiple layers we have different sets of tools which are helping us to create product produce or write or uh ideulate some stories. So these are the two sets of uh layers you can see on the screen. So from first layer to the last layer we have started using different AI tools at different layers. It's not AI tool is I mean we believe that AI tool is not a magic van. You started using any one chat GBT or any one any any AI tool and you are the master of AI that doesn't happen that doesn't happen in newsroom at all. It doesn't happen if you're master of one tool. it doesn't happen but thanks to Google team thanks to Google team's product project that we were part of and we started using different Google AI tools like Google AI tools notebook LM uh pinpoint and uh other tools that we started using and then the production happened in a different way and the second turnaround happened when I became the part of GNI AI skills academy and I thank Google that uh they came out with this program and uh just because of this program uh we became so powerful uh I mean I'm I'm a pro tech I'm not a tech journalist I'm a pro tech journalist but I started creating apps I created one app just with the help of what I have I understood I learned from this uh uh project so since we are a newsroom I recently launched this uh format framework of using AI in our newsroom or any newsroom that is 51H which we follow in uh journalism but we started following 51H plus 1 E plus 1B in our newsroom production as well. 51H everyone knows 1 E is ethics and 1B is bias check. So without ethical check, without bias check, we should not use AI in newsroom production that we follow very rigorously. You can see multiple examples here and I can say that all the examples you are seeing here are the output of the PTI infographic desk and the PTI the 100% output of PTI infographic desk is supported by AI tools. So each and every part, each and every production, each and every uh slide you see here is a result of massive work behind by the team uh in the data crunching, data verifying, data sourcing, data uh cleaning, then getting the idea from the data and then go to the production and the visualization of the production how it will look like. The next example you can see recently we used so many such products on uh uh during our budget this year's budget. So you can see this this looks very easy when you see on a screen but when you go and make this uh thing happen the team works really hard to get the data from 2024 till 2025 and putting the data in a CMS like structure in in the back end and to get these kind of videos. So at at front end this is like 1 minute video but before behind the curtain like two and three hours of work was there to produce these kind of videos. Another very interesting case study one day we were discussing about let's produce something to showcase how India GDP performed in last 50 years from where to where it went up. It was a very small discussion. My teammate Deepak said okay yes let's do it but he downloaded this data the 50 years of data of all the countries from world bank and the it was a huge huge data thanks to notebook thanks to Google AI studio that we found where was India placed in 50 years and how it went up in last 50 years and you'll see this production here how India is going in which year from which place to which place it's very easy to see here how it is working but it was like because we are agency news agency and PTI doesn't publish anything without cross-checking for multiple times so we checked it multiple times I mean I can say that more than 25 30 times we check each and every data each and every number each and every year then we produce this and it went up like this on our social media website there's another case study so all all I can I can say that Just because of Google AI tools and Google notebook element and pinpoint we were able to crunch the data because sometimes what happens you have the data but you don't know what to do it and crunching the data scaring the data clean the data it gives you the story ideas so all the story ideas we received from munching the data from the back end on different AI tools and getting getting these kind of production on on on screen. So what was the impact impact? 12x faster production we did 5x more content output we did and 500 more 500% more engagement on social what we achieved and uh one thing is good with the news agency that if we produce something the industry picks it up there's no competition so that this is why you can see the logos there so everyone started taking our infographics and PTA infographic desk and the production is like being talked about in the industry that's and and thanks to these two projects what we did with Google. So the road ahead we are trying to scale up we are divers diversifying in different formats and we are deepening AI integration in other parts of our newsroom that one bottom line is there that we are not using AI for writing purpose that's no no for us in in the newsroom but we are trying to use AI in different parts where the content is in raw format the content is not in the way it should be and using those tools to reduce our time the mechanical work and start writing when we have something some story ideas on the basis of those tools what we are getting products what what kind of ideas we're getting from those tools so that's it that's from my side I think I have one minute more than I was allotted so thank you thank you very much everyone [applause] >> thank you Pratush uh very impressive indeed to see you know the impact metrics that you shared also the time that your team is saving in doing all of the data data crunching. So you are able to present all of these stories to your audience in a much more appealable you know format. Um with that uh our next speaker uh is Ain Sharma who's the editor at Michael. Uh I know a lot of you would have visited the Google pavilion you know downstairs and saw you know that long queue right outside where there's a AI cricket coach so I can help you coach in cricket but also Avin will talk about what that means for a sports newsroom like his where the need to have real-time data analysis on all of the math stats you know on player comparisons needs to happen almost in real time and how he used some of you know the AI tools to you know ease that process is something that Avina is going to talk to us about Avvin welcome come Uh thank you Suri, thank you Google uh for giving me this opportunity uh to just give a quick uh overview what of what we do as an organization. So we are one India. So India goes in our veins. Uh and uh my is just an offshoot of one India the digital portal. It's the largest digital portal of India and we cater to almost every language which is there in India. And uh Mike Hill as well uh caters to almost every major language. We are in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Canada, Mallayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi and Punjabi. So uh my introduction to Google uh AI studios was back in 2025 in se uh September 2025 and uh I was blown away with the uh sessions that uh were conducted and uh that gave me an idea to because I'm a sports journalist and uh if you talk about sports in India nothing goes uh beyond cricket in a way it's a sad story at times because uh when you talk about sports there are other sports as well in the country and there are equally passionate athletes and fans. Uh but since we deal a lot into cricket and uh a lot of our traction comes from cricket so I thought of devising an app with the help of Google AI studios and I named it crick verse because the company's name uh I belong to is also vers innovations. So that's how the idea of naming the app came. Uh so that's the name of the app critic reverse and uh it uh it does a lot of things. Uh so I did it without see uh without without any knowledge of coding. I have zero uh knowledge of coding. I have not been to any sessions in the past and uh but with the help of Google AI studio I have been able to create a a a fairly decent application which I'm going to present to you. So this is the app. It's the over uh outlook. It can present it into uh different uh formats. It's it has a different uh we can pick up six AI personas depending on the newsroom requirements we have. Sometimes we defin simply have to work into the numbers. Sometime we have to work on the stories. Sometimes we have to just uh crunch the stats and present it and it goes on the way and the best part about this app is it is very easy to access as well. So earlier there used to be a lot of data overload but uh we don't know and it's still the problem that we don't know what's the uh what are we going to do and uh the popular websites the cricket websites which are there from where we generally get our numbers and the stats from our cricket info and cricket but you need to actually have a a mastery and the expertise to actually crunch the numbers from these websites. So what I did was to simplify the job of my writers who are not just cricket sports journalists. They could also be the social media guys and they didn't do not understand or don't have that much of experience and expertise of crunching the numbers. So what they can do they can simply give a prompt or a question and a query and they'll they'll get the data and the stats from the app. So here's an example. uh it has a lot of data on two particular players or a particular player. But here with the help of my tool uh the user can get it personalized or analyzed on their respective levels what the way they want it and that helps the newsroom a lot. the because the data that is available is very raw and very extensive and it requires a lot of time to uh crunch the numbers and give it a converted into a meaningful uh information. So these are the the personas that I was talking about and that how I crunch the numbers. It's not just I'm asking the questions. I'm also using some URLs and I with the help of these URLs and one of the best uh features of this app is the player versus player comparisons because you don't get it anywhere. So what I did was worked on uh the wipe coding and created and help asked the AI to help me compare two or three players data uh and from there we can uh build our stories from. So this is one of the example and it's not just the uh uh we can create social media content with the it we can create articles with the help of that and also we can create with the help of this uh AI Google AI studio we can because everything is inbuilt now into the app we can also create graphs we can create images and social media post generations have become easier for us we can create trivia quizzes and FAQs which are very very pertinent nowadays and for engagement with the audiences in the social the younger audiences as sir had mentioned some time back that the the attention span of uh the Indian readers or the readers as such is very low. So for that helps us to just grab their attention with the right kind of data we throw against them for them. So this is again an example of how and what all the tool can do for us. We can create stories. Uh the overall overview, the maps, the graphs, it's all there and it can be done within a fraction of a minute, not seconds but minutes. And yes, the impact it has had, it has had a tremendous impact on us. Uh the newsroom can obviously uh any writer can save 15 to 20 minutes of their time uh on a story per story basis. It gives a uh turnaround time has improved. The engagement rate has drastically changed and uh I'll just give a quick wrap of another tool that I have created. It's a comic book that I have created. I'll show how this kind of this is the kind of output we get with the help of the app that we have created. It looks so real. uh and uh the team is using it and uh it can create four to five maybe 10 comic strip panels uh as per the requirements and all these panels are editable so it's not that you have to go and uh rework on them again and again obviously you can edit it so this is the comic factory that I was talking about so that's the uh overall impact Google AI studio has had it definitely saves uh uh if not 8 hours it does save a lot of around 2 to three hours of my writer's time and uh in that time we definitely can work on something more creative more productive and uh the same numbers uh are here to before you. Thank you. >> Thank you Vin. Um and now we switch gears from the first love of the country sports to business news. uh another very popular ya you know in news and we'll invite up on stage Tan Sukumar who's the data editor at the mint and Tane continuing the theme of you know how a non-coder can also code build products you know dashboards and problem solve for their specific you know uh groups or you know uh teams t will talk about how they've been using some of what they learned through you know some of our programs to be able to serve their audiences better t welcome Uh thanks, thanks Google and thanks everyone for uh attending the session. Uh so I represent Mint. Uh Mint is a financial newspaper uh published from around 10 cities uh and of course distributed across India. uh increasingly it's uh our focus on our digital content has also increased u a lot and so we are a traditional uh we have been a traditional uh print newsroom and journalists are notorious for being very slow to adopt technology and uh all of what you have heard so far like Jagran new media and uh Mike Hale they are all digital but think of us we are we have been traditional print even slower uh and journalists have you know that uh also that ego uh uh of you know the pride of doing things themselves uh or executing the skills that they are known for uh themselves like uh around 2 years ago when we started talking about AI for the first time for say um something as simple as uh taking help for headlines. uh the response was will I now stoop down to that level or what will happen to my own skills if I start doing that uh or if I started generating ideas from AI what use am I so uh stuff like that but then uh also uh through training training programs like uh Google's uh we also learned uh you know ways to showcase like that those responses are also coming from a from from a uh lack of a lack of complete understanding of what AI could offer and uh now after using all the uh several tools uh we we know better like uh like say notebook LM how much time it can save and it can save you time to do uh better stories more creative stories right uh so I'll uh show you a couple of uh examples a couple of use cases that u that we tried in our newsroom based on uh training uh uh you know based on the skills that uh I learned as part of the program and so uh this is an interactive financial calculator. Uh so pretty pretty straightforward. So it's uh uh it's a for someone who's planning retirement how much money you should withdraw from your corpus in your first year. So sorry there are a couple of uh variables here like what is your desired uh what is your total retirement corus what is your allocation to say uh the share markets and uh how much time in how much time from now you plan to retire and based on that there is a formula that a that a writer had had in mind based on their studies uh that so there is a certain formula that uses these variables to come up with a value Right. So as simple as that. Now two years ago or 3 years ago if uh that columnist had come to me to say that you know can I can I with my article can I put a calculator that uh readers can use you know you know uh as an interactive uh tool. The response would have been like okay I'll have to go to the product team first of all. uh the product team will I'll have to facilitate meetings several rounds of meetings between the product team and the and the writer uh then uh they will you know there will be a first prototype there will be feedback there will be uh like it will take several weeks right or worst of all the product team will come back right after the first meeting and say what's the ROI it's just one article it will get you a few thousand page views what's the use right why should we make all that development effort uh to to make that one tool. So that didn't happen in this case because the moment the personal finance editor reached out to me to ask me if we could have such a tool with the uh with the article along with the article I look I immediately uh looked back at my AI studio uh sessions at uh at Google and I decided to try it myself. It was just one prompt uh and the tool was right there in front of me. Just uh a few like whatever the uh uh the problems would have been with the interface, they were just all all of them were solved within minutes. Uh it lasted 10 to 15 minutes. The best thing of all is now the person finance editor feels that this can be done with every uh all kinds of calculators. It's easily reproducible. uh she is excited that we can do it with nearly all articles personal finance articles without too much without any interaction with the product team without uh much without taking away much of the editorial bandwidth. Um and how this happened. So uh here's the uh here's how it looks within the story. So this is a story when you scroll down we have embedded that tool right here. So like it's within the story uh the the reader doesn't can read the article as well as uh try the tool themselves and get the figures for themselves right there and play around with the tool. Um sorry uh how it took uh how we did it. A simple prompt I and I didn't even enter the formula for the um calculation. I just entered a screenshot of the formula in fact from the Excel file and uh that that was the PNG file that you saw. So very quick process. Uh the next tool that I'm going to talk about is um something so we in in uh at the year end 2025 we we had a series called springboard uh where each and every uh stories lead image the image that goes on top of the story had a logo of the springboard series uh you know embedded within it. Now I think you can't see it there but so it's there. Uh now again there were 50 odd stories with that in in that series. Earlier what we would have done was uh probably just avoided the exercise uh the branding exercise for for each story of the series. Uh we would have uh asked the desk which is producing the each of the stories online to send the image to the design team for each and every uh uh each and every case and the design team will send it back uh with the logo embedded in it. What we did, we created an app for this. The desk uh is able to independently do it. And just two days ago, I discovered the that the desk had uh started doing the same without uh even checking with me for the AI summit. So all of the stories of AI summit have that uh have a logo on AI summit in them. They are using the same app. Uh so again reproducible. This is the how the app looks like. uh you upload the u the image and uh the the logo goes right there which you can place around where you wherever you want and then download it and place it in within the story. So uh uh so these are some of the ways that we uh have been like two tools that I showed but uh beyond this we are uh using our using all the like AI studio and notebook LM particularly uh to help us with story ideation and uh research especially and uh they save a lot of uh save us a lot of time. So that's it from me. Thanks a lot and all the best. Thank you Tana for sharing us you know sharing with us your examples. We would have been guilty if we couldn't play your video. So that was really the crux of it all. So thanks for sharing that with us. Um with that I would now like to invite Dr. Anubi Yadav the head of department for new media at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication who's also been a very uh you know eager partner with us on the skills uh you know AI skills program. uh you know we all are in a way AI or students when it comes to AI and she's been a master of teaching new media skills. So we thought who better to partner with the IMC and Anubi when we were rolling out this program and Anubuti will now share with us what her learnings you know from this program are and some of her favorite experiments from the group that we uh trained. Anubi welcome. >> Thank you so much uh Si. Uh very good afternoon to all of you and thanks to Google team uh Suri Dura for inviting me here. Uh in fact it's very challenging to be a last speaker and but yes I needed that particular applaud. Um see this when we are talking about artificial intelligence you know this discussion on artificial intelligence started with this question which all of us might have heard of and the question is can machines think and from that questions to this day you know we we have started asking you know the the question like you know are we training human beings fast enough to think or with the machines uh I've been part of you know a lot of conversations which are happening on AI uh in the newsrooms, in advertising agencies, in PR agencies and I think few months back you know the kind of conversation which was happening was whether we should be using AI and today the kind of conversation which is happening is that how should we use AI to be more productive. We've also heard lot of conversations wherein people were saying that AI will take away lot of jobs. Now we are listening to the conversations wherein everybody is talking about what are the new job roles that can be created around AI. And it is in this context we thought that we need to develop you know certain training program not only for the media students because I come from Indian Institute of Mass Communication. We train students who would like to have career in media and journalism. But at the same time we realized that we need to conduct training program for the people who are working in the industry also because for them also like they are experimenting exploring with this new technology and we thought that uh you know instead of offering this only to our students let's let us build a program and thanks to Suri and Google team who partnered with us and now we have a training program for the students we have a training program for the media educators we have a training program for the professionals from uh media sector and which include journalism also, advertising also, public relations also and another thing which we did was like we have a training program for the media professionals from the government service uh broadcasting. So uh what I'm going to do here is I'll share with you like our experience of running that particular training program. So, so we started with this training program with this premise that we need to bridge that gap. uh everybody talked about you know the transformation is happening in the industry right the people are integrating AI but at the same time if transformation is happening and we have listened to all the speakers when they talked about you know how they are using AI we need to train you know students and educators and professionals so that there is no gap when it comes to AI integration in the newsrooms and in the entertainment sector. So this is a unique uh industry academy partnership there are different stakeholders who are involved in this uh Google you know approached us we partnered with them uh IMC uh so it's not just Delhi campus we are conducting training program in you know different parts of our country which includes you know all our centers and also like other institutions then of course like we had professionals from Dur Dashan Akashwani publication divisions and as I said before uh we are also training media educators from you know 30 media schools across the country and then of course like we had guest speakers uh from different departments uh we had guest speakers you know you know the international people I mean who are working and researching in this particular area so uh the whole idea like when we are talking about artificial intelligence is that it's not about theory we wanted that you know those who are attending these particular training programs s they should attend those hands-on session they should try this particular technology they should build those particular apps they should create content so the whole idea was on you know learning by doing instead of you know talking about theory related to uh artificial intelligence so the the the adoption AI adoption uh followed a hockey stick learning curve initially it was difficult for us you know when it came to students when it came to educators there was some sort of appre comprehension when they were talking about uh use of AI or integrating AI. But the moment they start working with these tools which you know many of my fellow panelists they have said notebook, LM, Pinpoint at that point of time we saw that excitement and then you know uh they were building applications they were creating lot of content which was uh based on AI and using AI uh to create that particular content. Another thing which we did was like one-on-one mentoring and here what we did was we followed that sandwiched approach in the sense that it all starts with a mentor. Every train uh traininee were allocated one mentor. So ideation brainstorming happened with the mentor. tools were there to help them out to create content to build applications and then again mentor comes you know when it comes to reviewing their work and reviewing their content and of course like the human touch because the mentors were there it was very important and that is something which we uh included in our program now um another thing was it's it was not just learning or it was not just the application of tools as sir has mentioned very rightly it should not be tool specific what we focused more on that you know all these people I mean whosoever were attending those particular training programs they should identify what are their pain points what are their problems and how these AI application or AI tools they are solving those particular uh problems then of course uh this was the big hit when we talked about uh uh AI and AI integration and in our training program which was vibe coding there were lot of people uh initially very apprehensive of the fact that they'll be able to create applications and this is what you know happened and came out of this particular training program through VIP coding they were confident of you know creating their own applications and initially when we when we told them that you know after attending this training program you might have to build certain application or maybe like you know certain apps they said that we won't be able to because we don't come with the technical background and we told them very clearly clearly that you don't require technical background for this. The only thing which you require is you need to identify what the problem is and the tools are here to help you out in solving those problems. So as someone said that I didn't even know the sea of coding before joining the program and today I can actually build an app through wide coding and it has boosted my confidence tremendously and as you can see like when we are talking about the tool adoption and preferences amongst our trainees 66% of them they were using AI studio uh 60% of them they were using notebook LM and then 57% of them they were using uh Gemini for creating content when it comes to creating or um training you know professionals from the industry. These are the use cases which we saw most of the professionals they are using artificial intelligence for brainstorming and idea generation and that is like something which is very important because when you have to start a work the first thing is that how do you generate that idea even as a faculty today if I have to work on a presentation the first thing which I do is I have that brainstorming session with AI have the first draft and then I you know work upon on that or build upon that particular content. And the second was of course writing and drafting, summarizing long documents, preparing presentations, social media content, videos, photos, data, spreadsheet analysis, editing articles and translation and transcription. You know, this is how professionals in the newsrooms uh whom we trained are using uh artificial intelligence at this point of time. These are some of the prototypes some of the examples which you know I want to share with you. Uh this training program I mean it's not a long training program few weeks and that too like in a week we just have two or three hours with our participants and what they were able to build in this limited time. This is like one app which was created by uh one of my colleague Sri Lata she might be here somewhere in the audience also and this is called social pulse and this is a real time social media trend analyzer. So in advertising marketing we keep talking about social media monitoring we keep talking about social media listening. Now here is an app which is built you know around that particular thing and what it does it it aggregates you know all the tweets or post related to one particular event and then you know uh gives you the analysis of that. So a wonderful app which was being made in two days. This is another one which is like gamifying film appreciation course for media studies. As an educator, you know, I face lot of challenges and especially like with this generation wherein, you know, they are consuming lot of content from, you know, online or from, you know, new media. If you go to a classroom and if you think that you'll deliver a lecture and your students will listen to your lecture for uh 1 hour or two hour, it doesn't happen anymore. So, how do we create content in such a way which is more engaging? And this is what you know one of the educator has done. What that person has done is that it he had created this particular course in the form of an OTT program. So all the modules are in the form of an episode. So it looks like that you're watching a serial while you are actually undergoing this particular course. Okay. So this was the one fine. This was like the another one uh tap to share mobile app prototype which means many a time it happens that uh while we are in an event like this right we would like to share our contact details someone I was sitting with someone and that person asked me do you have your visiting card I said no I've stopped keeping visiting card so at this point of time this is the pain point right for the people who would like to collect cards but in today's time many of us might have stopped keeping that particular thing so Here's this application which talks about tap to show share mobile app basically to instantly exchange professional contact details. This one is uh to identify verified social media uh so uh subject matter experts. This was done by you know one of the professional from Akashwani. Uh this is something which is very important because for their programs they do need you know experts from the various fields. So this is an app which is built to identify those experts so that they can be called for their programs. This is like one of the uh app which was made by one of the faculty member again um making teaching content learning uh interesting engaging creating infographics mind maps and that is something which was developed by them. Publication division also uh you know worked on one of the application which they are using right now. Publication division uh by information and broadcasting ministry. Um you know this is a a magazine which lot of people they read especially those who are you know preparing for civil service examination. So there are long articles but what they did that they created mind maps for some of the articles so that it becomes easy for those people to revise the content which they might have read in that article. Um this is also very interesting. I mean I don't know how many of you are coming from education background but uh there are a lot of people in academia they do research and these researches are being published in journals and not many people go to library and you know read those particular journals. So can we simplify the content and the researches which have been done and the AI platform is being used to do that u uh mind maps on that uh infographics on you know those particular papers so that it becomes easy for people to understand. So the biggest barrier was not tech. The biggest barrier for our participants was time to practice. And this is what you know they kept telling us that we have learned something but it becomes very hard in the sense that when they go back to their newsrooms uh they didn't get much time to practice on on that particular thing. So that was the uh you know the the barrier which we faced. So what is the way forward? The first is we need to have more academia industry collaborations like this and we're really thankful to Google uh who partnered with us in conducting all these training programs. They actually like got best of the speakers for all our sessions. So I think you know we need to have more of such training uh you know collaborations uh so that whatever new products which are being built by all these tech platforms it should be introduced to media schools J schools because these are the people who are going to join media industry in maybe like um uh one uh year or two years. Second is like we need to train teachers and students and also journalists in tier 2 and tier three cities and that is something which is very important and of course like ongoing knowledge sharing through journaling and we conducted pre uh summit uh AI summit and one thing that came out from that particular summit was that uh you need to create a journal you need to uh start a journal wherein the best practices related to AI is documented. There's lot of good work which is happening right now. If you go outside there are a lot of people working in this area but we do not have a journal wherein we can uh document those successful practices and also the researches by the people who are doing lot of work around artificial intelligence. So that's all from my side. But today when I came here, I thought that I'll ask this question to to the participants and to the audience. And I'm doing it right now because if I thought I'll do it. And my question is how is the AI Josh? >> How is the AI Josh? You have to keep this Josh high because uh in one of the addressed by our honorable minister of information and broadcasting he talked about you know um creating uh you know India creating India mission and I think you know we'll be requiring this jo at that point of time. Thank you so much. [applause] >> Uh thanks professor Anubi for such a energetic and inspiring session. Uh with that we come to the end of this session. Uh I want to extend a word of thank you to especially our chief guest for today Mr. Prabhad. Thank you for joining us and sharing the industry ecosystem insights with us. And a huge thank you to all our publishers who came forward to share uh their interesting AI experiments uh their creativity the passion that they bring to this project. Uh thank you so much all and for a lovely audience u thanks a lot. Hi everyone. Uh thank you so much for joining us for all the sessions today. We'll be starting the final session at 3:45 in the next 10 minutes. So if you'd like to move around and come back in, please do and make room for uh new faces as well. Thank you.
