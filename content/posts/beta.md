So, you are trying to do a beta launch of a new Product? Here are the ingredients you'll need for a successful beta launch!

The beta launch is a way to takeoff your product from the ground and gets a few customers that have the problem your product solves. 

Be very deliberate about the problem you are trying to solve.

A Beta has room for errors in the process and functionalities without compromising on the core offering with actual value creation.

- Focus on one user persona
  - Find your audience 
  - Estimate your audience and build a waitlist/Access CTA to build on the hype
  - Find out the communities these users hang out in and ask for inputs 
  - Onboard them as the first users to use the products 
- One Problem
  - Focus on One problem and solve that better than anyone else 
- One a Product that helps builds trust
  - Build a Minimum Loveable Product over MVP
- One Hook
  - Make sure the hook enables an easy word-of-mouth referral loop among users of the product
  - Use the hook as your one-word explainer
- Don't think of a beta as a beta
  - It's a launch at the end of the day with expectations
