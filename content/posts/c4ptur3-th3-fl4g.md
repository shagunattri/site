### c4ptur3-th3-fl4g
>A beginner level CTF challenge

**Task #1**

`c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?`

Understanding leet text shouldn't be hard,and if you get stuck use [Universal Leet (L337, L33T, 1337) Converter ](http://www.robertecker.com/hp/research/leet-converter.php)

Decrypted: 

`can you capture the flag`

**Task #2**

`01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001`


Straight of this is binary code and to decode it you can either use pen and paper or use [rapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html
) to decode the text.

Decrypted:

`lets try some binary out!`

**Task #3**

`MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======`

One easy way to crack ciphers of this type is look at the = in the end. From my observation Base64 encoding give ='s in the end. So we decode it to find the answer.

`base32 is super common in CTF's`

**Task #4**

`RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==`

Looks like some base conversion more like base32.Let's decode it with base32 for the answer.

`Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.`

**Task #5**

`68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f`

Pretty evident that is it is hexademical.Decoding this can be done with python,online decode or the boring pen and paper.

`hexadecimal or base16?`


**Task #6**

`Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!`

The cipher here gives away the route ti decode it and it has to do with the integer 13 and use ROT-13 for the solve.

`Rotate me 13 plac???`

**Task #7**

`*@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX`

More like ROT-47 where we use symbols along with the letters and numbers.

`You spin me right round baby right round (47 ??????`

**Task #8**

`- . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -.`

`. -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.`

Pretty easy this is morse code.

`telecommunication encod???`

**Task #9**

`85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68`

ASCII and can be decoded using the ASCII table.

`Unpack this B??`

**Task #10**

`LS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0
