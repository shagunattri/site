system that Nvidia is doing with activate. Uh we'll be announcing this officially tomorrow. Um which is why we would request uh just no phones at the moment, no videos because we want to break the news tomorrow to the wider public. So we very much appreciate it, although it might be a little disappointing. uh Prateique, wherever Prateique is from my team, he'll be taking some content. If you want to be able to circulate content tomorrow, uh you can give Pritique your email and he'll try his best to to refill all those requests. But thanks again. Okay, great. So, um getting started. Um could not be more excited to be here. It's an amazing energy this summit. Um, I've been fortunate enough uh from Nvidia's perspective to be given leadership of this region alongside my other regions I lead which is the UK and Ireland, Europe, Middle East and Africa for our startup business inception. I'm sure some of you are founders in the room. How many founders are in the room tonight today? I mean amazing. Great. A good proportion. And uh how many technical engineers in the room as well? Great. The vast majority. That's exciting. Well, look, we want to explore now what this partnership can look like uh for the Indian startup ecosystem. We're really going to dive a lot deep into activate acquits personal experience amazing experience here in the ecosystem itself. And we're going to spend a little bit of time as well talking about what inception is, our startup business from Nvidia's perspective and how that can really help all of you, all of you founders, all of you engineers as well grow the next generation of AI startups in India. So maybe first uh >> I'm allowed to take pictures. [laughter] >> Over to you. I mean it'd be great just to hear your story right it's such an exciting story we met in bank Bangalore I think it was now I think it was about a month ago now and I was completely captivated by it right and I just immediately saw the partnership potential we said let's just do this this is great for India you're the person for the job here to be able to actually really grow the next generation of asars but maybe you just take us through your actual entrepreneurial journey how you got to the decision to start activate >> yeah no thank you so much it's amazing to be here uh so many founders so many engineers Uh great to see uh this is a 200 room capacity. I think it's 300 people but incredible uh and so much energy like you said right Tobias at the summit and so excited about why we are here and this partnership. Uh so yeah quickly my name is Akrit V. I built a company called Haptic for about 11 years. Um the first product that Haptic released in 2014 was an AI chatbot. Um in 2014 and 15 my number one job was to go around telling everybody uh uh in the world including all my investors what a chatbot is. Uh I guess that question is settled uh for now uh after after all these years. Um and then um you know um when I decided to start haptic uh in 2013 uh it was with a single uh purpose of how do you build incredible um AI companies from India. Um and haptic was really my way of uh trying to create uh that AI platform that India can be proud of. Um you know I often say that whenever the book of this company is written it the title will be a decade too early. um you know uh if we would have uh done something about it when uh we had large language models maybe the story would have been different. It was a success. We did well. I'm I'm very proud of what we accomplished. But after we sold the business and then um I was thinking about uh how do I still continue down that same purpose of truly building AI in India uh and doing it today uh when the technology is just a whole different paradigm. Uh and that's when I thought that okay look let me go find out what's going on what's missing and I realized that um um you know the energy and the technical talent that we have in this country is second to none. I truly believe that the next generation of uh AI companies in India will be built by incredibly technical founders who are um for the lack of better words obsessed with the technology. Um so then I said okay look how do we enable them how do we give rise to them and sorry pun intended but how do we activate them uh and that's when this idea came about that okay look what if we put together this new age um venture capital firm where what we do is we work with uh technical founders very very early uh and by very early I mean uh all our investments so far have had no pitch tech no docks and not even a company. So the first time that we wrote uh look we want to invest in your company the company name actually was a placeholder because we still had to incorporate the business. Um so work with them very very early spend time with them given my operator roots spend anywhere between 1 to 3 months working on with them on the idea. uh we are fortunate that our investors in our fund known as LPs uh and the broader advisory community that we have consists of some of India's best founders and some of the world's best AI leaders. So we get them involved in the creation of the companies uh and then you know invest right at incorporation and work with them for the next 20 years uh to build out India's AI footprint. How exciting is that? Right. So, um an exited founder completely embedded in the uh the ecosystem here. I think um is it 100 plus angel investments you've done as well? >> Yeah, 107. Way too many. >> 107 angel investments. So, think of all that experience, all of that network, you know, um you didn't mention some of your LPs, but but I know them. Some of the best LPS you can imagine globally as well as within India. And I think this focus on the early stage is so important here, right? This um this ability to be able to cultivate AI ecosystems from the ground up is something that we at NVIDIA have been doing for pretty much all of our corporate history, right? It was actually our original go to market was within the research communities. We were you know Jensen likes to say he was going around selling CUDA to research labs all over the world. So literally spending time with academics, researchers in AI and there's there's something magical around the fact that an AI researcher can create a multi-billion dollar market, a completely new computing paradigm and what that actually means for AI in general for all of us globally, not just in India but also just spreading throughout the world. And I think that brings me to my next question. So like you mentioned this slightly but what why now first and foremost? So why activate now? You could have maybe done this a year before. You could have done this maybe two years before etc. And then what do how do you think this is going to play out like what kind of generative AI companies are going to form? What is that future going to look like for India? What are the kind of focuses AI natives maybe model producers etc. >> I mean why now just look at this room. I mean that's a good example right? I really want I think that I think we got lesser hands. Let's ask that question again. How many AI founders or wannabe AI founders in the room? That's the right answer. All right. And that is the why now of activate. I you know I I was talking to somebody at dinner last night. The one hill I am willing to die on for the rest of my life is our technical talent particularly on the tooling application side of the AI stack is probably the best in the world. Probably second to none. I think that uh once you give uh infrastructure which includes models and compute, hint hint, uh once you once you give these two things to Indian founders and developers, they can do magic. Uh I think their ability to take these things, build it at scale, build it for India or for the world, build it economically, build it with constraints is like I said probably second to none. So I think in all seriousness uh the why now is you know you see that over the last 12 to 18 months Tobi is both parts many pieces of the infra are now in place the models have gotten to a point where there's enough options available between open source closed source the closed models can do a lot more now that allows for faster experimentation costs have been dramatically reducing of inferencing u they're still not there where we would want Indian inferencing to be but dramatically reducing. So all of these create the right you know sort of set of uh tailwinds for us to build companies. In addition I mean just look at what the country is trying to do to evangelize AI. I thought the best uh description of this was someone wrote on Twitter yesterday right which is that how many of how many of you struggled to get into Bhat Mandabam over the last three days? Everybody right? How many of you complained about it? most of you right but the point is this was the same thing that happened 10 years back when the government made digitization their core focus and today because of all of that chaos that happened 10 years back we are one of the only countries we travel all over the world we're the only one of the only countries where I don't have to carry a wallet to make a payment >> we are one of the only countries where I get stuff delivered to me in 8 minutes even over here and we are one of the only countries in the world which can enter an airport without a boarding pass because we have digital systems. So that same chaos of today which the government is creating is generally a net positive. I understand this is all chaotic. We don't have seeds but all of this lays the foundations to create AI for the next you know 10 or 20 years. So that's part of the why now. Yeah it's just like I said this coming together of so many things that prompted me. By the way, you know, the other story that I rarely say is all my friends, especially founder friends, and a bunch of them are here, they asked the first question they asked me last year when I was thinking about activate was, "Boss, you are an exited AI founder. It's time for you to go raise $100 million and build the next AI company. Why do this?" And the answer was the same. It just feels like a product like Activate, I keep calling it a product, a product like Activate which is tailored to technical founders in India, working with them handin glove very early is what we need for the ecosystem. >> Yeah, such great points there and I think um you know humbly I'm a visitor to this country and and I've had nothing but rewarding experiences working with Uni, my team who've been amazing teaching me all about it. But I think the thing which I find really interesting with what you just said and which I found so interesting about India in general is this ability for the government to support scaling right and you mentioned before with digital identity obviously the payment rails and what could this look like in AI in 10 years time realistically like you know there was probably some skepticism right when these first uh uh sort of scale rails were first introduced and now a lot of those fintexs for example are on the cusp of IPOing have IPOed some of India's largest companies right so we're very excited by that ability to scale and I think also the reason we're so excited about this particular partnership is your vision for what those startups can look like. >> Yeah. You know, with this sorry with this digital rail stuff, you know, I'm sure people have attended events over the last sessions over the last 3 days with this digital rail stuff has been talked about a lot and it's like on record, oh my god, we what's the UPI of AI? What's that moment? And I my only thing to everybody is and especially for you as you're thinking about the market, be patient. India takes time. India is not for beginners, right? Again, uh [applause] add display over here. This would be a fire hazard in any other country. Right? So, you know, this will happen, >> right? It's just the people who will win, who can be patient, who can be missionoriented, who can build for the long term. um you know uh my my most famous not more famous my one of the quotes I like the most which um you know I go to bed with every single day which is the reality right um Ruchi Sharma who's a very famous banker who works for Morgan Stanley has been saying this for years India is a country that disappoints both the pessimist and the optimist um and the reason is because the optimist in here optimist walking around here will be oh my god like we're going to invest 5 billion tomorrow we're going to have five sovereign models, computer is going to start flowing off from the air. That's not going to happen, right? And the pessimists I see on Twitter writing about uh you know somebody wrote what's the point of doing all these events when we don't have our LLMs. I mean neither is right, right? You just have to be patient. You have to think about what's our lane and ultimately things will happen. >> That's a good segue. So if we're not in that stage, which we're clearly not of, you know, chronic optimism, right? But we're also not in that world of pessimism either. Where are we now in India? Where are we at right at this moment? And what is the solution for you and activate and obviously us partnering with you from Inception's point of view to bring us let's say to let's just say you know with some conservatism a more optimist optimistic future. >> Great question. Fundamentally a very strong belief that we have is we are very early right it's day zero maybe day minus one when it comes to India's AI story and the challenge that we have in narratives and AI is that because the rest of the world has been doing so much we have this FOMO in this country uh that oh my god I'm losing out I'm missing out I turned 21 I'm so old you you know um but but we are just you know the nature of our country and economic story and growth story today is that look uh we we will always build um mostly on the top layers while there'll be some infrastructure and R&D we'll mostly build great applications um and that is just getting started funnily if you look at the last few Y cominator batches which is a good proxy to see what's going on generally in the world you know even in even at YC or Y cominator it's only now that the application layer is truly taking off in the last two batches so we are very early u pratush my partner and I he says this uh very often that you know the best AI companies in India are yet to be created they don't exist right it's it's they're hopefully somewhere in this room >> I think that's uh that's that's really true and one of the things which I found so interesting about our first conversation all that a few weeks ago in Bangalore was your thoughts around how do we keep talent in India right because obviously and this this is a this is a similar problem we have in Europe by the way so this is not just an Indiacentric problem but basically the top talent does typically go to the US either to raise money or to work at you know an open AI or anthropic whatever it is right so maybe give us your thoughts about how activate and then maybe I can chime in a little bit from inception's point of view how us together can actually create let's say emotion you know forward thinking you know won't be immediate but thinking of our long term because we we certainly connected as well that this is a long-term thing from a video's perspective as well. We're always thinking long term. How can we keep the talent in India? >> Yeah, I mean this is a starting point like I said again. Um so um uh okay maybe we're recording it but sure I don't care. Um I mean Trump is helping [snorts] so uh I think like uh look I spent 10 years in the US and I came back. I did my undergrad in the US. I was in Silicon Valley when the app store and the iPhone launched. Uh so call me a case study, a foolish case study for what it's worth. But you know I left all of that and moved back to build AI in India. So I deeply feel uh feel for the problem. Um I think here's how there was three just last week there was a leading AI researcher from open AI in in the Bay Area uh who reached out to me and set up this call of Indian origin from India um you know they have no shortage of anything in life and basically she reached out and said hey listen you know things are good here great here we're doing a bunch of cutting edge research but I really want to do something in India and I want to do an AI how should I think about it and my answer to her which is the answer I'm going to give over here is that look if as a 22 year old your motivation in life is to be the most financially successful with the most highest quality of life um then look it's debatable whether this is the country to build in for the rest of your life if that is the sole goal or the primary goal. However, if your goals are along with that be a part of something that in my view will be a transformation of a country for a long time and along with that build missionary companies and you care a little bit about legacy of the story that you were a part of then probably India is the right place. Yeah, that's such a great point and I think for me I've now, you know, I've been to India only twice humbly. Uh but I've met over 200 founders and one of the most exciting >> 200 is too little. We need to get you. >> No, I'm only just getting started. I'm just a beginner. But um but the the thing which always comes through for me which makes India very different actually because I may I meet thousands of researchers and and founders all the time in Amir in Europe etc. all over the place Middle East Africa is there's a real um sense of wanting to stay here and doing things for the public good. So I want to scale an AI company and it's not just become a unicorn. It's not just to IPO. It's for the benefit of others, right? And I think that's that's a wonderful takeaway for all of us actually in the rest of the world around why to actually start these kind of projects, how to work with uh with yourself and us here at Nvidia and maybe I'll just explain a little bit about >> Yeah. And also like sorry just before you go into inception uh you know like it's also like like India has such unique problems like as a technologist it's also fun to work on >> right like I mean like you know the whole whether it's a payments infrastructure or how to do payments at scale um or like I said you know the whole 10-minute economy that has taken off or even e-commerce is just such a complex beast. So even with AI, I mean you know the next panel actually has a bunch of very uh exciting uh founders talking about similar things like the nature of problems they face and how they go around it is just so different and as a technologist that's what keeps you going. Right. >> I'll tell you a bit of a funny story which will back that point up. Right. So when uh when I was studying at Oxford um my professor was reviewing some of my work um and the feedback was it's quite harsh feedback to be fair but he said look you know it's not bad but I just want you to know something if this was a meritocracy every student here would be from China and India and I've always taken that away and I've always had the privilege right of working with great uh folks from India and big tech but also when my time is Oxford all the best students there so there's such extreme talent in India that wasn't that wasn't a surprise to me at all to be honest with you but I think meeting so many founders spending so much time with everyone everyone in this particular summit really Nvidia's role in these kind of ecosystems is is almost like a convenor right we're here to provide infrastructure and compute we're here to encourage founders >> so on the compute point [laughter] >> let me let me just finish this point we'll revisit it so we're here to provide scaled infrastructure obviously and uh we'll be rolling that out um with a long-term vision but also really what we're interested in is working with founders with uni and the team here that do such great work um to be able to really also address the kind of products you're building Right? Because we've got a very comprehensive compute stack and platform called CUDA which most of you will know of. Um the the exciting thing about working with Nvidia in our inception program is alongside Activate from a technical point of view because these are technical founders is why I'm so interested in your particular program is that we can really dive deep and accelerate what you're actually building within your product. Maybe it's with a library, an SDK or a tool that you're unaware of. Maybe it's an open source model that we've actually got on the market now. Our Neatron family of models. It could be many, many, many different things. But think of our platform is clearly optimized for our hardware, right? So what we want to do is really lean in to the early stage founders with you in the activate program. So let's say if you join activate, you've got some funding. You'll also be matched with us here at Nvidia to help you with your product development to be able to help you also with things like um you know what kind of model I should select if you're building a model end to end. You we can work out how we can actually really optimize your inference. We can do all kinds of things, right? And and for me that's exciting because if you're thinking about it in a wider scale, you're going to do a lot of investments. You're going to support a lot of early stage founders. It's just the first year we're working together. It's going to be many, many years to come. So, if you actually take all of that and you scale it out and we're there from the very, you know, from day zero with you, inception and activate, right? We're going to be able to build better products faster with our stack with our technologists, which means there's going to be better probabilistic chances of good success, right? That's what we're really excited about here at Nvidia. And we've been doing this as well. We've got a rich history of this all over the world as you know. >> Yeah. You know, I here's this is my plug for Nvidia. And this is something I think for all that you do, this is the part of the company maybe you're a little more humble on than you should be. Uh and I'll I'll say this, there are at least two AI companies in India that I know today. One of both of them very popular. You know, both of them, they're all over the AI summit. U they're building at the frontier of AI. Both of them, the founders have categorically told me multiple times that the company and our products wouldn't have gotten built if it wasn't for Nvidia support. Categorically like it is it is uh and and in one of their cases I'm quoting him right directly one of those cases we wouldn't exist without Jensen you know was literally the line. And why I say this is that um you know um like I think people don't realize besides of course this whole whatever GPU compute and you know what is it five six trillion company the Nvidia is fundamentally an engineering company it's fundamentally a deeply technical company. So the moment you throw them you throw some technical problems at you um you know I have firsthand seen the way that the you know everybody within Nvidia gets excited and rallies up and in a lot of those cases it's amazing to see Jensen directly get involved sometimes in you know doing these things. So uh just reiterating uh which is when we met you know we're super excited about this partnership where uh uh anybody who you know works with us uh we will be we we will try to provide this platform where we can directly engage with uh teams at NVIDIA solution experts designers uh to help problem solve and and build these >> 100% and I think as well the way that Nvidia thinks about partnerships right and um all of the you let's say all of your first cohort would also be considered partners of ours is that everyone all of our partners success is quite literally Nvidia's success. Jensen's very clear on that. Um we are a company with a rich history of partnering with uh with everyone in the ecosystem. We're called the AI partners of AI partners and we want to continue that rich tradition within this partnership. Right? So we really want to be able to support the early stage ecosystem here that there could literally be no one better and I mean that sincerely than yourself and what you're doing at Activate to be able to do that. And for me personally there's there's a really let's say there's a really good track history of this at Nvidia as We've done this in many many ecosystems and it really is it really is a common solution right you bring scale compute so that actual engineers technologists AI researchers like all of you in the room today can actually experiment with significant compute at your fingertips as opposed to limited compute with capacity then you bring great solution engineers architects which we have on our side plus amazing investors folks that have done it before can actually really tell all of you how to build a startup and that recipe actually really grows AI ecosystems basically and that's what I'm most excited about coming to India uh because the solution set is the same but we we obviously lean on my team everyone else here like yourselves to actually understand how the what are the parameters here so we've got the solutions we know how to do this but you tell us what the parameters are how do we partner with you and then quite literally your success and the founder success becomes our success and we're very into making you know in in many kinds of use cases whether it's applications whether it's a breakthrough research we want to be able to support all of those use cases robotics physical AI healthare life sciences the list goes on um so Yeah, could not be more excited for this partnership. >> Amazing. Uh should we take a couple of questions? >> Yes. >> Uh all right, we can take maybe two questions. >> Yeah. >> Hey everyone, my name is Pranav. I'm a technology architect. seeing the current evolution of AI uh with respect to the government sector or the private sector in India and across the globe that India will serve. how we can let Nvidia to provide a infrastructure that is more like stringent at the same time more reliable uh that can reach to the end founder uh who is not like u a very u like a very uh go to easy person uh to like have the capital raised, right? So, what are the programs that you want to put light upon that? >> Okay, that's actually great because it touches on a part of the inception program which we should explore just briefly. I think we only by the way have time for one question unfortunately we just got signals but um but basically at inception as well as focusing with our cuda accelerated platform uh with founders on how to work with their products with their engineers their CTOs etc. We also are partnered with all of the compute providers within particular landscape. So for here it would be as we all know the major CSPs uh but also newer providers like Yota E2E uh we provide credits for those particular compute providers as well. Also not many people know that you can join inception. You can get credits for our actual partners as well. Uh and simultaneously we can also help guide you but we won't make the choice for you on which compute provider you want to choose. Right? Obviously because we're partnered with everyone we have a good understanding of the actual landscape itself and we can definitely give you some advice of where we think there's you know capacity based on your use case but we don't make the decision that's very much a founder decision. Um so that's another great part of inception. And I'd say you get a good understanding of where you know how to basically uh fulfill those requirements you just requested. >> Great. Thank you so much. >> Thank you. >> Excited. >> Thank you. Thank you everybody. factions just know too deeply about what each other is building. But just for the benefit of the room, can we just go around you know you guys telling a little bit about you, your background, the kind of problems you're working on, the kind of technology challenges and solutions you have sort of uh worked towards and solving and uh we can then sort of begin with that. Shamal. >> Great. Um I'm Shamal. Previously I was at OpenAI for three and a half years. um leading kind of the applied evals team um joined open air before chat GPT and kind of led and scale multiple teams um and just over a month back moved back to India to kind of build from here and help accelerate research enable founders um so starting interactive intelligence which is kind of an applied AI group um focusing on you know solving population scale problems with AI Hello. Check. Yeah. Hey, I'm Sam. I'm one of the founders at Dash. I we build uh micro trada and have a tooling to build ability to build micro drama using uh AI have been early in this journey since we started pre-Chad GBT we started uh when I saw stable diffusion first version that's how I got into this boat and been a fun journey since then. Super exciting. Things drop every few days and things change every few days. >> How often do things break? How often do things break? >> Every day. [laughter] >> Uh I'm Pratik Desai. I'm founder of Kisan AI. uh like as a educational background I have I'm computer scientist with AI background but have a agrarian family in India even though I'm based in San Francisco Bay area I started 7 years back this company to help Indian farmers build AI models that can be directly useful for them uh you can call us one of the pioneering company who has been developing generative AI conversational tool or even uh post- training models But we are focused only on agriculture and uh you know we've been working with farmers connecting them with their needs and expanding growing. >> Thank you. Um I'll probably take a very tough controversial question at the start. You know there's im immense energy immense optimism immense passion for building and solving really hardcore technology problems from India for India for the world. Um, as we discussed and we heard and reiterated multiple times, the talent in the room and in general in the conference is second to none in most places in the world. What's holding us back? Why are we not really producing um really hardcore um you know, solutions to some of the most pressing problems in the world? Uh from your vantage point as builders, you know, what's what's holding us off? What's probably going to unlock us? Any lessons that you guys have uh learned while building from the field that you'd probably like to share with the audience? And we can start with Pratik. Uh so for your controversial question I'll answer controversial answer and I I don't think we have that much talent that we estimate maybe we need to train we we are not there if you are living in valley and the sul has been around like the smartest people in the world and I've been working 8 years so we need those courses and education we do not have something you will like stand out in valley or the talent that we have there but I think the biggest problem is with the the quality of the data uh four years back when we started curating data before chat jeopardy we were using gypy 3 APIs which were launched in 2020 so I had access to them and the data was so bad and we've been collecting lot of agradient data from universities and scrapping them and they were like pictures with phone converted into PDFs and there were no like OCR model that kind of serum dropping right now so we are like literally human doing annotation and all so yeah the journey has been difficult because the data And comput is common problem everybody know we do not have GPUs and all so you know that I wouldn't touch that but in talent I think we still have gap that we need to train amount like quality of the paper that get published in India they're also not that great things like that so we need to bridge that gap sham anything to add you have been in the Bay Area ecosystem for quite a lot of time worked in the best company that is um you know probably at the center stage and the foundation of the entire revolution anything to add any any perspectives that you see in terms of differences skill sets, ambitions. >> Yeah, I think I I see the concentration of talent kind of coming back to India especially now with huge infrastructure bets that serum is making. I think honestly what's holding us back? One thing is just the sheer urgency of getting things done. Uh the cost to building has gone so low. I mean you should have you know cloud codeex agents running in the background you know every night. you know that that's what bothers a lot of engineers these days is do I have codecs running before I go to bed um and just tell you a bit of a story right I was talking to someone you know researcher um came out of IIT and doing some research on sample efficiency few of the folks and you know he got offers from few labs but he chose to just do this on his own and I'm like why are you doing this like you could be working on anything else and he's like I just care about this like AI is a national security risk if we don't do anything right Now there's literally going to be no social economic status if you're not taking this urgently. So I I think just the urgency and the the motivation to do things. I think one of the things in Bay Area is you know there is a lot of abundance right? So people have a lot of options to do it. Um we have a population scale problem and so it's not like we have the abundance to do it but you know the median age here in the summit is like whatever 2830. So I mean you know people can make it here and and and you know at least show that they care about this subject and being able to do this. I think just driving in with urgency and making things happen especially with the tools you have available today is the thing that's honestly holding us back. Swami your take. >> Yeah I think I'll iterate what uh Ark said. We are a huge set of people and larger the mass the velocity is lower with the same momentum but when we move we move a lot of things. So it's just a matter of time. I I actually don't I I I actually don't think about the talent as much. I do think the top 1 percentile of India matches the top 1 percentile everywhere. Maybe the median has a difference but I think the world is pushed by the top 1 percentile. >> Lovely. Uh let's now try to contextualize the discussion a bit more and talk a little bit more about the real life problems that we're trying to sort of solve. I'm sure none of us here uh maybe with the exception of Shamal had a lot of luxury in terms of abundance of resources to try and go over some of those problems and some of uh the things we're discussing before the room. So um you know try and contextualize some technical problems that you're trying to solve for in your 0ero to1 journey of actually identifying the problem solving it finding early customers getting feedback getting the ecosystem feedback and the help to actually get to where you are and uh you know what's unique what's different what would you have wished otherwise >> yes I'll put my optimistic hat for the India now so so like many founder over here like you know when we started like the the the data and everything was really bad but like because we have also this culture where as uh Jamal was saying if there is an urgency things will happen. So when we started the first AI project for agriculture, the farmlands were not plotted at all. Like we do not even today have everything geommapped and my first AI model was to take a satellite images and plot the land. But I do not have uh numbers and images and they existed as like a JPEG file in the regular district offices, right? So the by law you can just get one page for your village. You don't get everything else. But then like then how do I actually move and connect the numbers and all but then in India if you're like a startup founder you figure it out you go to the copier outside of the office because he is the one making copy for all the farmers and you give them like hey I'll give you some lumpsum amount you give me all the villages and that's how we actually started collecting the data and now we were able to digitize and it's very important it's needed but you know like if if you have no passion about solving a problem you can make things happen people will come help you out we have been helped by many other folks like you know throughout our journey including open AAI and Nvidia and all of the folks so there like a jugard you have to do it will work even compute like we don't have compute like open AAI I've been always asking around for grants to train model we open source it but still like you know you can go around people will give you grants some compute there are many initiative going on and you can make things happen you know uh we can complain about compute for soda models but for smaller many application that can actually make difference in India you do not read that much compute actually >> interesting Swami a slightly different flavor of the same question for you you were one of the first few people in India to actually work on generative models when it came to images and pixel domain uh you went through a cycle of actually discovering euphoria with image generation maybe realizing that that's probably not a great business and then eventually now moving to videos you've always been pushing the frontier on some of those fronts uh without compute, without capital, without maybe a lot of talent as well. U so maybe you would probably want to share some context on what kinds of things you've faced in the journey, what's uh what's exciting, what's fun, what's probably not so fun. I think something that we have from day zero uh done well and has been the most uh interesting insight that I have over the journey is that um all models or all products rather work best with a great tight feedback loop right and something that we as India has an insane uh talent around is to use the products that you build and that is something we did from day zero of our company where we had users of our product of a creative product inhouse to get the feedback loop tight from day zero and like that has helped us keep iterating so much faster and despite not having the capital or the infrastructure to to train models we could fine-tune the hell out of everything because we had data to and keep creating so much data. So that's that's something that that insight I think has taken us this far. Let's let's hope it takes us further. Um yeah, sorry. What was the other thing? >> What's probably [snorts] not so fun? What's probably um something that you wish? >> I think this constant tussle of lack of resources of course not fun. Uh but I think it's part of the journey. >> Shamal, I think a little bit different from your vantage point. You're very committed to helping shape the ecosystem in India. you do a lot of work with the uh AIRO uh you do a lot of work with bunch of us uh in general in the ecosystem. So what are you seeing probably holding off really smart young cracked engineers researchers uh from sort of say um really unleashing themselves? Are they choosing the same problems that the that their peers in the valley are choosing without the same resources without the same nuances? Are they probably not focusing their efforts and the energy in the right direction? Um what are your thoughts? What are your perspectives? >> Yeah, I I think one way to answer that is like honestly the exploration exploitation trade-off. Um is a lot of builders I know have you know the intensity and talent to go do it but often don't take time to explore and plan ahead and planning is so important. I mean we're building intelligence and we know that planning leads to better you know long-term coherence in agents. Uh we don't do that as humans. So I think um you know this is one of the things that Sam actually told me in one of the meetings and uh it was like taking exploring and planning really really important. If you're going to do something for the next 10 years which is going to be your life's work um and it's going to be like one or two bets you're doing take enough time to plan it do many things and then see kind of what works. Um, and that's honestly the thing that I see some of that differentiates like really great builders from the ones that sometimes get hold held up by structures and things that don't really let them explore a lot. How much of a um you know how much of all of these could be attributed to say lack of capital, lack of uh um you know I would say um inspiration capital that gets you off the ground but also gives you scale up capital way ahead of your traction numbers justifying that kind of a thing. So how much of the struggles that we are all alluding to in the in the panel today can can actually be attributed to lack of capital or lack of capitalcentric resources? Yeah, I mean hopefully capital you guys are solving now with with the fund. So um and and more I'm I'm hoping more of that uh you know also comes through. Um I think capital's I think moving forward on the preede seed I think you know there's a lot of capital flowing in uh I I think the challenge is really knowing what to build especially with very shifting consumer behavior cuz now you're building an app and you know with wipe coding you almost have this like era of personal software right where I was just talking to someone yesterday and it was like similar to how you you know just made photography really easy and now you just have a re of your you know photos that you don't even see you're going to have a peel off your many SAS apps and software that you don't see but you're just going to create it for you know you know a few times. So I think with with that like knowing what to build for like a niche for even like 1 million people is like super difficult and trading on that really fast. So I think the taste becomes really important. Um and I think by taste I mean it's really kind of like understanding what your customer really wants and then iterating with them. Uh and ideally you're the customer of what you're building first. Um so other than capital of course capital is a constraint especially on the infrastructure side when you don't have access to compute cheap compute um and you know you want to postrain models and you want to fine-tune models and you you can't do that with you know uh just with like few GPUs so I think to really compete moving forward on the foundation infrastructure layer capital is definitely a constraint right now but the application layer I think there's a lot of opportunities with with lot of funding coming in >> that's a very nice segue to the next question that I had um and maybe we can start with you sidep What is probably the one unfair advantage that uh people building companies out of India would uh have compared to say their counterparts and peers. We discussed about challenges. We discussed about lack of talent. We discussed about lack of resources, lack of compute, um you know, lack of capital. But are there any advantages? I mean, >> we already talked about it. It's the feedback loop that we can set up here that is that can be insanely better and insanely close to you that you will not it's much harder. So we work with a lot of uh uh people in US also and one of and my co- uh like competitors in US also and one of the core problems they keep seeing is so we make content using AI we make a tool that makes content right so one of their core problems is that how do I get this studio to use it every day it's hard you have access to 10 studios and they will not use a halfbaked tool every day we on the other hand I can set up 10 studios within my company overnight and have them use my tool every day and I pay them for it. So that I think that feedback loop advantage that we have we are not abusing it enough and we should be doing that. Pratik no that's the first one second thing that we have seen is the willingness to adopt to digital technology and AI that's like so we have also solution in US but in India when we launched 2023 around chipbury time the conversational AI we had within like few months 150,000 farmers basically using it and like in in in the feedback sense we had actually folks figuring out our number from different directories calling us giving us live saying hey can you add this more data at that time the models were very early like gypy 3 3.5 so the data was very important that we have been curating the models are better now so they already have so many information but the farmer are actually traveling 100 km when I was speaking in Bangalore from the other part of the karnataka to came he came and just told me about like his tractor problem it's like can you add Mahindra tractor's manual in your conversational tools because my worker keep breaking it and then you You'll never see like in in other countries or like where come from the like in states they will be very nice to you on the face. Over here they will criticize you. They they will you know to break you down but that's good because otherwise like you know you'll not have actually a good product delivered if you don't get the critical feedback basically. >> Perfect. Um I think uh you know probably moving to the final section of the panel any one piece of technology or trend that you're personally very excited by that you see in the adjacencies of your domains that you work with or founders you interact with something that you would advise probably say many more founders and technologist in the room to try and think building companies around maybe >> yeah um one thing is like build for the agents like build for the agents like if you're a founder figuring out what to do thinking about payments think about how agents would transact act. If you think about recruiting, think about how agents would like go and and find the right set of people for for any founder or a company. You know, if you're thinking about like, you know, solving the deployment ch for enterprises, think about how agents would solve it. So, putting yourself in like an agent first like AI first point of view, uh, and building for the agents is kind of the biggest thing you could be doing right now because again, step one is you understand the customers really well. But when the customers are the agents, I think it becomes a whole different game. I think something that I'm super excited being in creative is world models like like being able to control generative 3D worlds on the fly. That's super exciting and that opens up so much more creativity that I don't think we can even any of us can imagine today. So super excited by that. uh I think uh if you guys want to note it down but this is going to be really important next month you will start hearing about it's going to be recursive self-improving agents this is happening you're going to see it and how they're going to transform everything around you in terms of automation if you're not ready it's going to be like 100 kilometers per hour bus going to hit you so keep note it down keep searching whatever you can find learn, implement, be familiar with this thing. >> I think >> yeah, I think to add to that like it's a very good segue to like you know how you should calibrate AI progress. I think there's like two axis that you know I really like to look at AI progress. One is a time horizon, right? So who's seen kind of the MER curve of you know um you know AI doing increasingly you know challenging tasks and doubling you know doubling amount of time like every seven months or so. I think the time horizon of where agents can do tasks successfully at least at 50% or more is one access and two is things that are verifiable versus non-verifiable to so you know to's point I think thinking about where you know AI is doing things that are not really verifiable things like creative writing or like taste or or direction or something like that versus things that are very verifiable like math and and code etc. So I think again I think the compute will shift more towards things that are nonverifiable because again that's really important um you know for humans and again that that's something where humans have an edge and again that's where also where like things like compliance and legal and all that really come in. So um just to add to that I think that's like two axis where I look at like you know progress and kind of just getting up for that what's next. >> Such great points. I probably had one more question for all of us but in the interest of time we'll maybe open up the floor for some audience questions. Um happy to Okay. >> Start with you ma'am. >> Um hi my name is Vidushi. Uh Shaman I had a question with you. You said that uh planning is very important right like before doing anything. But for young entrepreneurs like us, we are often told that don't plan, just do it, just don't think about it, just do it. Just get in the uh zone, just get in the battlefield and take the war. So thoughts on that? Like planning is important or doing is important. How do we balance that? >> Yeah, I think it really depends on what stage you are at. Like if you've, you know, you're just getting out of college or thinking about what to do next, unless you're like really sure that hey, I want to go solve like this post AGI problem. I want to go solve AGI like you if you're very clear and if you have super clarity then fine just go do things if you're a bit unclear and if you're like super early in in kind of your you know stage of thinking then planning is super important because that also if you have a co-founder potentially if you're looking for to work with them I think that process gives you a chance to actually understand what your team really wants and how thinking they're thinking through things and then you can just go kind of do execute so I think it really depends on the stage at where you are yeah >> okay great thanks just a follow-up question any tips for that any tips for planning Um I think one one best thing is like I think writing is very important right I've seen a lot of builders and founders spend a lot of time writing it brings you a very insane amount of clarity into your thoughts so um even Greg Brockman right if you heard one of his podcasts he said that he keeps like a journal of thoughts almost like his chain of thought that he keeps like writing in a journal uh about decisions and I think that just gives you an insane amount of clarity and um so writing is again like a great tool for planning. >> Can start with somebody at the back. Um the gentleman the green shirt maybe >> Hello myself Satam Sankar and I am from Newton School of Technology Rishard University and I am in my sophomore year. At the current moment of time, I don't know whether I should pursue research or uh do uh uh research I don't know whether I should research field I am not yet sure. So how do I navigate my path? Also since uh Indian mentality currently middle class belong to I think of it as foundational backup backup plan. I can't go all in on research as of currently but how should I navigate through it? >> Swamid you want to take that? >> So I think I'll it's very interesting what he said key uh planning right. So I think early in your career I think it is important that you explore more things. At least that's how I looked at my early career. I spent like four five years just figuring out like like what interests me, what engages me, what seems to be fun, what seems to people value all of it. So and like I did not jump I tried to jump into entrepreneurship early in my career. Most of them did not work out. So like I think it's it's your journey. You should explore everything. Keep an open mind for everything. So don't don't like the question that I have to choose one is itself a policy. You don't just explore everything right now. >> See uh first of all you have to stop this excuse of middle class like I grew up in poor farming family. Second research you can do in generative AI research you can do in applied AI research you can do in anything. So research and AIS are not different thing basically you can do anywhere right? So it's about your patient like what what do you care about are you willing to spend time hours like nights and then stick to it that what matters basically right so first of all like you have tools chat GPT free versions everything talk to it research go back and forth back and forth put your thoughts inside learn from it you have tools already available see the differences and ask it the same question if you ask it will give you the same answer say like hey research you can do in AI I generated AI applied AI. So what I would say you have free tools use it as much as possible. AI is probably uh 80% 90% to the professors that you have in your universities. You can they will answer they are PhD level most of the models are and they will give you all like you know multi- uh domain answers not just like a one person answering from like I I I'll answer from AI and agriculture but AI can answer from everything right so use those tool and then decide and then have patient about what you're doing then you can follow this question is basically about it's you asking yourself not us because your commitment will define your path where you going >> I think we are out of uh time for the question. Thank you so much guys. [applause] >> I would request our panelists to collect our momentos from AI summit.
