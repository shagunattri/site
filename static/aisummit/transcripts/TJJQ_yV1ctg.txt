one of us in this room um technologydriven financial fraud there there are there are number of scams happening uh every single day the conversation on that is not really happening in terms of how it can be it can be addressed uh and uh I am a I am Kunal Wala I'm a partner with Dalberg and um I will be talking a little bit about this uh uh this topic today uh I'll set the context a little bit um I should Ina, I'll set the context a little bit and why we we feel like talking about this issue is is is so important. We all know about India's financial inclusion journey. It's it's it's somewhat of a case study that people talk about in the financial inclusion ecosystem. We have 900 million odd subscribers. We have uh more than half of our population uses UPI. trillions of rupees of transactions made every day. Uh DPI India's DPI case study is is spoken about globally. However, what this has done over the last few years is also it's created this large attack surface for fraud as well for fraudsters, right? And this is where it it really becomes scary, right? India. I mean, if you just look at cyber security and fraud together globally, it's the third largest economy in the world. We we're talking about 10 to 11 trillion dollars annually. In India, we we're talking about 30,000 crores of frauds, financial frauds annually. Uh not proud to say this but financial online financial frauds is the fastest growing sector in India's digital economy right now. And if you just trans translate that 30,000 cr number into um you know what this means on a per minute basis we're talking about six lakhs of frauds happening per minute. >> Okay we're going to take a group photo as soon as I finish the introduction and then we'll jump into the panel. Right. So as I was saying, so it's a it's a fairly large problem. Um, and uh, as we as we talk about this problem at the macro level, senior citizens are are sort of losing their their savings. We have households that are that are suffering because their livelihoods are getting destroyed, so on and so forth. Um, but what are the kind of solutions that are out there? There are different types of solutions. Technologies being used to fight frauds. There's a lot of policy works that are happening around uh in in India around uh regulating fraud. Um there's also the role the really important role of behavior science in in finan in in in in in these types of frauds right and we'll talk a little bit about how all of these interventions how these solutions come together to address this challenge which has really been exponentially increasing because of the role of genai because of genai now it's fairly easy to create deep fakes that look really real it's very easy to just use one or two minutes of voice recording ing on someone and then replicate that voice for a for a scam. So the level of scale, the level of customization has has become has become really really easy. Right? So in particular, we'll be talking about how customer fraud is being driven in the age of AI and what kind of interventions do we need to to fight this fraud. And I couldn't have asked for a better panel to discuss this. Um, and I'll very quickly give uh high level introductions to the to the panelists because we now want to jump into the group photo and then the the discussions. But I'm I'm joined I'm pleased to be joined by by Samina Singh. She's the founder president of of Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. Thank you for joining us. [applause] I'm also joined by Pawan Bakshi who really has been at the forefront of financial inclusion the India's telecom revolution for for years now. He is the lead of inclusive financial systems at the Gates Foundation in India. Thanks for joining Pavan [applause] and Shwa Singh who leads strategy and regulatory policy work at Bharti Airtel. Airtel is is really at the at the front of of financial frauds and how financial frauds happen and the customer interface there and and can't wait to hear more from you. [applause] And finally uh Nir Bhnager who's the founder of Atlas of uh behavior change in development uh which is a tech platform for behavior change uh and we'll and will talk about the the role of behavior science in in not just that fraudsters are are being able to leverage but how we can use that for interventions as well. Uh welcome Nita. [applause] Okay, we'll very quickly now take a group photo and then we'll jump into questions. Okay, thank you everyone. That was a great discussion. Uh that's how it usually happens. So let's just I'm seeing the timer here which started much before we started. So we'll try to stick to this. Um let me let me start with um the discussion straight away. Um and maybe just helping everybody understand the context a little bit uh understand the the history a little bit. Uh Shamina if if you allow me to start with you um can you talk a little bit about um how you've seen the role of AI in financial inclusion? You know I want to start a little bit on the positive positive on a positive note right. How have you seen AI help with with financial inclusion? what are some what are some examples that that you can you can talk about there in in terms of uh financial inclusion and and really who is benefiting the most uh from from this technology. >> So thanks Thank you so much for having me here. Uh it's a it's a real pleasure and an honor to be on the panel with so many distinguished experts. Um just uh very quickly, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth has been around for about 13 years and um we operate uh at the intersection of impact. Mastercard as a technology company in the payment space uh made a commitment about 11 years ago to bring a billion people into the formal economy. We achieved that commitment in 2025 and uh in large part because the work of uh inclusion has to do with making sure that consumers are at the center of the equation. So I think the good news story around financial inclusion in AI is that many of us are thinking about um inclusion uh as the default defense by design. And so I think as we see with financial inclusion you know when we started this work the rate of uh accounts by adults I think was around maybe 40%. And thanks to leadership in India specifically, I think we have seen now we're up to about um 80% of adults around the world have an account. I think the role of uh AI and the role of technology is that we've moved from an analog economy which is where we originally started with access and inclusion um to a datadriven economy and now the AI economy is creating hockey stick growth. So putting consumers at the center of that equation um creating products that are uh inclusive inclusive by design but are defensive by design I think is going to be the key to inclusive economic growth >> and and Shamita can you also talk a little bit about how as as we're as you know AI has been used for financial inclusion quite a lot what are some of the principles around responsible AI that that sort of come to mind right and because consumer protection is a major issue now but how is Mastercards thought about these principles >> yeah so I mean look we did a we did a partnership with consumers international where they studied the regulation in over in eight in eight countries and the thing that I don't think anybody anybody will be surprised by is that there are really good regulations that protect consumers on paper but they're not actually being enforced in real life and that's part of the problem is that once a consumer consumer engages with the financial system if they're scammed in the first one two 300 engagements, it's very difficult um to build trust in the system. And so part of the way that we believe in it and looking at it um at Mastercard is, you know, you you talk a lot about uh know your customer. Um we think about know your agent. And so we're trying to bring the same principles that we've brought to um consumer protection with financial inclusion into the uh the agentic space as well. And so I think this notion of privacy, transparency and protection um are the three pillars that we approach the work with at Mastercard. And I think again those are going to be the things that sustain us through this big uh the evolution and the revolution that is AI. Yeah, >> thanks so much and and we'll definitely come back to to those three principles you spoke about. But Shita, just um from AEL's point of view, uh how have you seen the the fraud landscape in India changing especially as as you're seeing AI AI being more sort of more forefront, more consumerf facing with Genai now becoming a technology that everybody's familiar with, right? Can you talk a little bit about uh your experience? >> Yeah, true. So just um continuing from where Shamina had left out, there's a definite possibility or potential for um positive inclusion through AI through using the new technologies that we have at our disposal currently. But you can't deny that the scale of harm that currently exists is also because of the same technologies at play. I think when you were setting the tone of this session, you had said you would actually answer the same question that you're asking me right now that with AI in place, what has changed? I think it's not just the sophistication of scams which has changed but it's the scale truly. So as per the latest report or as per the last report that I had read uh close to $1.3 trillion were lost to scams globally out of which 48 billion that's what you said about 30,000 crores were lost in India alone that kind of scale is not possible if the scams were happening manually that scale is possible only because there is technology or there's AI at play here uh in the same report that's the GSA report that had come out that's a global uh anti-scam alliance they said that in the last one year close to 75% of Indians had encountered spam or fraud in some form and uh a single individual had uh around 119 scam encounters if you look at multiple forums that he engages in it's whether it's Instagram any social networking site call SMS uh Amazon e-commerce so around 119 scam again that kind of scale is not possible manually and the reason why a A lot of people and a lot of educated people also so are falling prey to these scams is because the sophistication is also increased. So just take for instance earlier if a scam had to happen a person had to first probably get some contextual knowledge about you. They had to learn probably your language. They had to learn your financial background. They had to understand some kind of persuasion tactics. Now all of that can be done uh very quickly. they can be done with the excellent level of sophistication and that can be done at scale. So just to take your words I think in the last one year one sector that has grown leaps and bounds is the scam industry in general. So probably that what was once just a scam a simple uh crime of sorts it's just become more magnified. It's become a industry scale operation with the kind of numbers that would put any small country to shame also. >> Yeah. And Nat wanted to bring you in over here because you you are are working at the intersection of of technology and and behavior change, right? And I I just wanted to understand how fraudsters have been able to at this level of scale manipulate certain behaviors of certain segments of the community. Can you talk a little bit about the vulnerabilities that they've been really able to tap uh at this level of scale using technology? >> Yeah. Uh I think super important question and uh when we think of fraudsters uh before some of the more recent uh news reports that came in uh that everyone's kind of been talking about these industrial complexes that exist in Myanmar Cambodia. I think the mental model that we have of fraudsters is this like small shop uh individuals who doing certain things but they are a very very important part of this whole equation. They think they're given targets. there's a lot of coercion around uh committing fraud, innovating to find new uh types of mechanisms. Uh AI like Sha was saying AI has really reduced the marginal cost of committing fraud. Right? So the cost of actually staying with somebody over multiple weeks and months and even years in certain cases that marginal cost has fallen to near zero because of information because of AI the marginal cost of deception has fallen to zero. So there's a lot of innovation that's happening uh in that on that side on the fraudsters and it's happening where they are traversing different mediums uh the uh they'll start on let's say WhatsApp they'll go to a phone call they'll go to an email so they're not contained in these silos where regulation sits or even private sector access they are contained in certain silos and their levers are within that silo but if if the fraud attempts are traversing silos and temporally they're spread over multiple weeks and multiple months you need a whole different paradigm of approaching it. There's so much you can do from a technology standpoint. Uh but there's a lot of behavioral stuff that also needs to be done to build immunity against this. And in my mind, I see that the end equilibrium to be a yin-yang kind of an equilibrium where both of these things need to work together for kind of adequate safety. >> And we'll talk about that the the the balance that we need to find between the the two types of interventions. So Pavan just bringing you in into the conversation at the Gates Foundation. Um there's obviously financial inclusion is not something that we've achieved yet. I mean there's still we've opened bank accounts but usage still needs to be increased. So there's a lot of push that needs to be done but at the same time we're hearing that you know um you know technologydriven financial fraud is is a major major problem. So as a philanthropy how do you balance this now? Have your priorities changed in the last few years? Has the thinking changed in the last few years? So yeah well thanks everyone. Uh the issue is that for AI to work well you need data and India has done exceptionally well by structuring the data it's gone and created in terms of the ID system in terms of payment system in terms of of the data exchanges account aggregator diger the works. So there is data right but that whole piece as you rightly went and said that 90% of adults in the country have a bank account today but not as many of them use it uh actively about half of them you you use it regularly and in the process of increasing usage while there is about relevance and suitability of products and you know and the type of of of products to use and handsets to get to and the network availability And there are whole loads of challenges and social norms there. There's also an added thing about protection, right? Is there trust in the ecosystem. I think there is a a deep discussion on the you know at all levels is do we make a DFS risk-free or do we help in in creating an ecosystem which is trustworthy. So it's not a activity based thing but a larger ecosystem based thing and as Nan said it's it's multiplicity of stuff right so and the and the and we are seeing this because the same tools that provide access can also be used exploitatively right so as an example if you take mobile money as as an example or digital is very important to reach the last mile which are really remote where the banks will not go and serve them regularly. But in the same way that allows a fraudster to reach out to those very you know folks to do that and to to go and scan them out and even small value scams happening at large scale are actually large value scams. So this whole thing is is is changing and for us one of the things that we've now you know introduced in our strategy is to work on customer protection that includes data it includes privacy it includes consent it also includes hardcore work on customer protection and we believe it's at two levels one is obviously at the level of technology and regulation and policy. The other is around what happens on the consumer side and on the consumer side uh change in behavior is one element of that but but it's not enough because you can't train a lot of people across across geographies and segments in a similar way. So it's complex but essentially u it's an important aspect to look at. So we've changed our strategy to include the customer protection uh stuff in this. >> Yeah. and and as we as we start now moving the conversation towards solutions I mean having been in this industry for a long time what what can we learn from previous uh customer protection interventions what are what is relevant now in in this world of of of AI >> I think the first one is the lesson that we've learned is that uh gone are the days when uh when when when when the regulation technology. It's now about technology I think leading uh regulation and that and that's changed a whole load of stuff. Um and along with that comes how do we react to things because if if it's happening on tech I I remember you know in the old days when I was there at Etle as an example we h we had a process of saying the team would look at revenue assurance in a way by saying are there loopholes in the product or the process which will allow leakage that was more to do on the on the institutional uh uh side we could do same things and more on the consumer side to test a product to say can this be gamed are there ways of addressing this I think so that's one lesson the other is around we've not had a lot of experience in handling multi-regulator multiple geography multiple start points from a telecom for or the or on the internet ways of arriving at the same level of customer. So there are those things have gone and changed which we have zero experience on I think. So we need to learn that up very very quickly and and try and understanding what that would mean for the end consumer because she's the one who's actually going to be hurt you know at the end of the day everybody else can pass on the blame and move on right and I think the the other thing which we need to change is that we've in the past done training consumers to say here's what you should be doing and that meant that we've passed on the liability to the consumer that we told you if you screw screw up, right? It's your problem. We need to change that and we need to be equally responsible uh as the consumer is to be able to say that look we we didn't know this was going to was going to happen. It has happened. We are with you in solving this and taking this down completely. There are I I think there are enough and more like that uh on the regulation priest will get empa in Kenya and the loans there it just skyrocketed right for small value loans we people are blacklisted there are things which uh which emerge we can't even try and imagine unfortunately so yeah I'll probably stop there >> no thanks pav and and one thing you mentioned was that um you have to use technology behavior change is is good it's not enough so it has to go to hand in hand and and and that's where I wanted to bring you in right because airel the telecom industry uh generally we see a lot of innovation there we you know I I and I appreciate those innovations as a customer because I get those messages that don't click on this link I would have clicked on can you just talk us through what's what type of innovations Airel has launched or maybe other telecom operators have launched and and also what's worked, what's not worked. >> Um, thank you Canal. Actually, I'll start from where Pavans had just left off that while of course a lot of organizations including uh his are doing an excellent work at consumer awareness and especially for the vulnerable segments of users uh teaching them how to not get defrauded. But I think it is upon us as corporates as well to do our bit uh to be empathetic towards the users and to prevent the harm before it has happened. So as a telecom operator we are very cognizant of our responsibility that we are the first line of defense. Um we are the first entity that a customer both a fraudster and a consumer interacts with when a fraud has to happen or before the fraud happens. And um for the last two years I'm very happy to say that Etle has taken this head on and trust and safety has been at the forefront of our corporate responsibility has been and business priorities. Uh we've launched multiple product innovations and interventions that have actually helped the consumers at large. Uh I'll just give you examples of uh a few of them and I'm sure a lot of people who are sitting in the room today must have experienced them as well. So in September of 2024, we launched a realtime spam detection uh voice and SMS calling feature. That means when you are on call and if we believe that the caller is a fraudulent caller or a spammer, you will get a warning spam real time on the call and you can then take a call whether you want to pick it up or not. But we are warning the customers well in advance. Similarly, we did so on the SMS side as well. Uh as of January of 2026, we have flagged close to 71 billion calls and around 3 billion SMSs. Uh this was also acknowledged by MHA last year. That's Ministry of Home Affairs I4C. uh that's the uh nodal agency for um scams, frauds and any kind of fraudulent activity that on for air users the amount of uh financial frauds the quantum of financial frauds has reduced by 70%. So we know for a fact that what we are doing is helping the customers in the end. Then u in May of last year we launched fraud detection link uh solution. That means we realize that a lot of fraud today were coming through uh malicious URLs. Now it's possible that the malicious URL is coming to you via SMS but it's equally possible that it's coming to you via a WhatsApp or Telegram Instagram or through any other medium but at the end of the day that URL is going to open on a nettle network. So whether it's mobile broadband network or a fixedline broadband network it is going to open on a nettle network. So we realize that it's again it's our responsibility to make sure that if the link is fraudulent and we have u multiple multiple factors to look at and before determining whether a link is fraudulent or not to not let it open in the first place and that also we realized was protecting the users from uh inadvertently clicking on something that may lead to a fraud. Um then just about 10 15 days back we've launched a third solution uh in our arsenal that's OTP on fraud. Uh again uh as per uh a report we a GSM editus report that we had come across we realized that a lot of frauds were happening when a person was under stress or duress. That means you're on a call uh and the scamster is impersonating to be someone that you trust and you do pass on the banking OTP to him while on the call. So we realized again looking at the network signals if a person is on the call and an financial OTP comes as an SMS we give them a a timely intervention and ask them that it's uh do you know this customer and do you want to receive this OTP until the time a person does not say yes the OTP is not delivered on the phone that just creates a very timely pause for a person to know that this might be a fraudulent number now in doing all of these customer intervent vention. What's interesting is that we did not look at the personal attribute of the scammer. So when we are doing these analysis, we're not looking at this uh or we're not answering the question that the person who's doing or calling is he a scammer. We are answering the question that is he exhibiting the traits of a scammer or not. And for doing that I don't need to know whether it's Kunal or whether it's Pavan. I just need to know that the number is exhibiting the traits or not. So for instance there are 250 odd parameters that are at play here. Uh for instance um whether a SIM swap has happened on this number in the last 30 days or not. Whether uh there has been a device swap or not. Uh is the location verification happening? How many unique calls is that number making in a day? So for instance if you're calling 300 people in a day but you're not receiving any calls back. And all of these 300 numbers are unique numbers. It's more likely that you are a spammer and there is a possibility that in all of this mesh there are some genuine people. So for instance your blue dart career person also gets caught. So just a few months after our first solution we launched a business name display solution as well. That means even if it is a promotional calling you would still get the name of the company who's calling you. So again you can take a call that if it's an insurance company who's calling you can decide whether you want to take that call or not. But at the same time you can decide not to take that call. So that's been a range of customer interventions that we have done just out of a corporate responsibility without uh patronizing the customer. Now as per our learnings as you're saying we realized that although all of these interventions have massively helped the customer and we've got enough uh validation from both the regulator and the customer uh one thing that we have realized is that scam or frauds are not isolated to one platform and that's what Nirat was also saying that it's not just restricted to phone calls it's not restricted to SMS anymore it's a whole of ecosystem that needs to act so there is the possibility that a fraud may start through a phone call but it may end at WhatsApp or it may end through a banking transaction. So till the time the entire ecosystem players they don't come together uh the whole problem of fraud they can't it can't be solved in silos. >> This is uh fascinating one additional question from Pavan. Does this reduce churn? Is this a strong business case? >> It may it may it oh you're saying it does it reduce churn? Oh yeah, I'm I'm sure it does. I thought you're saying that uh the people who are calling might also beel users. Uh >> I was what what I was trying to ask is now that you've been seen as an organization which is more supportive and customer protective are you seeing larger number of customers come in and stay on for longer. >> Yeah. So um it's difficult [laughter] to attribute it singularly to these features but what we have seen is that also uh I think all of us who sitting here know that none of these features were given at any cost they were free of cost for all users. So there's no monetary benefit that I'm getting out of launching these solutions but there is a greater attribution of trust and safety that is given on on network. So there is a possibility that a person is on network he may feel much safer and oh yeah absolutely he she [laughter] >> thank you so much Shamina really keen to hear from your experience especially in terms of like how Mastercard is navigating these challenges what type of solutions what type of awareness campaigns what are the different categories of solutions that that Mastercard is pushing through where have you seen things work uh and and where are some limitations ations that you feel more collaboration is needed around. >> Well, I think that the um I think the the the main issue that I the thread that I'm hearing is and I I can't remember who brought it up, but it the onus is on the consumer and that's not fair. And so I think part of the the way that we've approached it um is very similar to the products we use. So if you have a Mastercard or a debit card or a payment card um if you are defrauded, you get your money back. So the red address system is built into the product. Um and I think that's a very important thing to think about um is as we're building products and solutions um the onus has to be on the company and to make sure that if you are defrauded you have a system in place to get your money back to have redress. And that's what I was talking about earlier is it's written in all of the regulations, but the systems, as you just said, everybody's operating on different platforms. So, a consumer has to think about, okay, is it my telephone? Is it my banking? Is it my uh internet? Like what? So, and they're getting defrauded in in every single place. How is that building trust in a system? Um and and I think it's less frankly about is it the CSR thing or the it's your business case like that is the the way that we approach it is the business case for Mastercard depends on the satisfaction of the customer. I mean that's that's business. And so I think you know in 2024 alone Mastercard um switched uh f uh stopped 160 billion transactions that were fraudulent and that was in 2024 when AI was just starting in 2026. That number is going to quadruple. So these are not things that can be put on the customer to figure out. So yes, I believe in education and I believe, you know, and we're even as employees, we're taught, you know, don't fish, don't all the all the things. But at the same time, I think as people who are sitting in places of of of privilege and pos and and power, we have to make sure that it's on us to figure this out. And and the last thing I'll say about this is the reason why I think payment systems are so successful um is that nobody wakes up every morning and says, "How am I going to pay for something?" They wake up and they say, "I want to purchase something." And so our job is to make sure that we're in the background making sure that those purchases are easy to make. Making sure that calls and texts and MSS or SMS are easy to make. If we put the focus on the process behind it, we've lost the battle and frankly that's that's where the competitive models of AI should be playing is if you're not operating in that space where you are invisible um and that you're the process just works then that's the place we need AI to be and that's the place I think we all want to be. >> Thank you so much. >> Thanks so much. Uh Nath just bringing you in over here from a customer resilience perspective. What more do you think can be done? What does the landscape even look like in you? You you've done a lot of research around um you know what type of uh awareness interventions, general behavior interventions are out there, what's working, what's not working. Can you just give us a lay of the land and and also I'm very keen to sort of understand how can experts like you probably collaborate more with technology companies, right? What's what's the what's the give and take over there? How does that work? If you have any thoughts. >> Sure. So, so let's start with the definition of resilience. In my mind, when it comes to fraud, resilience is the difference between exposure and vulnerability. The if two people they have the same exposure to fraud but they are differently vulnerable. Uh that is the resilience. Uh that's one way of instrumentalizing the resilience. uh if you look at data points across different countries uh if you look at Singapore and UK for instance there's a couple of really interesting data points where uh because they put very strong regulation and technology in place uh a bunch the overall macro numbers in fraud are coming down for sure but what's increasing is what's called a authorized payment push right so in both of these countries the authorized payment push kind of uh fraud is increasing at a fairly fast clip and if you look at it it's because uh people are willingly engag engaging in transactions which may not be purchase transactions. they just might be transferred transactions and I think there's a lot of behavioral piece and it's not just education I think it's about the entire life cycle of where behavior can come in and play a role nudges uh pre-bunking now when you look at um if you look at what I think needs to be done and where expertise can come in there's two parts to this very similar to what let's say India stack did 15 years ago so one is do we know from a behavior science perspective what works at micro scale right and then the second question is do we know how to scale that uh thing at micro scale to macro country scale or global scale. Right? So the good news is that at micro scale there's a lot of very rich evidence on the interventions that work to protect people against fraud. Right? So there's bunch of research and there are very very uh large effect sizes of certain kinds of inter interventions. So um so pre-bunking inoculation uh bridging the intention uh to action gap certain frequencies all trainings lose efficacy within six months. Right? Uh so there is a package of interventions that can that are very cheap to deploy and and those things work. Now the question is how do you scale that? How do you scale that in an ecosystem where all of this is happening across different kinds of entities uh uh banks, fintexs, uh communication providers of all different kinds, right? So Airel probably and Mastercard at the vanguard of such capabilities, right? There are so many smaller entities who who don't have that sophistication in house. So I think we need a similar way of thinking about it. How can we create like a behavioral public good, right? almost like a API or a stack which then can scale such insight into all parts of the ecosystem and is constantly learning because this is not almost like a whack-a-ole exercise where on the one hand fraudsters are going to innovate they will AI itself as a vector is is becoming uh sharper so you'll have constant kind of proliferation of new methods so solving for those experimenting and that data then has be owned by the ecosystem, right? There's a lot of value in not privatizing that data and actually making that a public good so that interventions can scale. So, so, so in short, I think one, we need uh to have a very clear uh role of behavior versus technology. I think the vocabulary really matters. It I've seen it getting simplified very very often. Uh number two, I think we need to think about the whole life cycle of transactions, not just let's say um paying for something. And number three, I think there's a huge amount of value in creating these behavioral public goods on technology rail supports which make it very easy for a willing organization to do it. Right? If you look at the the cost of hiring a behavioral team or it's quite high and for smaller firms, if it eats into the bottom line, they'll probably not do it. The default will to not do it. And in in different jurisdictions, the liability sits very differently, right? So so so there's no financial incentive to also do it. But if you make it easy uh by offering such a plug-and-play kind of a stack solution or API solution then more will do it and and you learn smarter you learn collectively. So so that's at least a thesis that we are working on at EBC. >> Yeah thank you so much Nat and it's really fascinating to see the range of solutions that people have spoken about and the scale of the solutions also and still what are some of the gaps that need to be plugged in. We have about 8 minutes left. I have a few more questions, but I just wanted to open it up to the audience. If anybody has any questions for the panelists, please feel free to raise your hand. There's a mic roaming around over here. Maybe we'll take two questions. >> If you could just briefly introduce yourself and ask the question and if it's directed to any one person. >> Yeah, thank you very much Kal. I am Indiar, uh, an entrepreneur, new one. Um I think whenever uh customer initiatives are launched the adoption curve of the customer is slower than the adoption curve of the fraudster and two years back and this question is for Shua. Okay. I think despite the RMS and RPU pressures has taken this courageous act of putting all the measures in place. Now what is the learning? what is the perspective uh what's the kind of decision making you have taken at that point of time uh to take this courageous decision and hence what's the message and learning for the other corporates and institutions to take such calls to protect customers >> uh can we take one more question over there like we have recently ly seen the indigo case uh that it holds the 60% of the um 60% of the aviation if any AI would dominate the AI industry and next days the China would cyber attack India it can take away the data of uh citizens of India what would government do in this case >> I'm guessing You you you any panelist can answer that question. >> It it is for all. >> Okay. Fine. Uh thank you for that. >> Thank you. >> I'll start with your question and I'll try to attempt your question as well and then of course we can open it up to the panel as well. Um thank you so much first off. I hope you're a natural customer. [laughter] Yes. And then you've seen um these interventions at play. So it's the same question that Pabinser had also asked a while back that did you see any uptake in ARPU did you have any uh definite customer gain did you see any benefits um on the business side as well so when we introduced these interventions back in September of 2024 I don't think that was the intention uh for the longest time the number of fraud that were being reported across the whole ecosystem across all three telecom operators was staggering and we really wanted to do um something for the customer um and we and that's a completely in-house solution that I should tell you. So we got our data engineers in place. They started tinkering around with a lot of telecom data that we have without of course touching the personal data of the customers and we started experimenting with what kind of logic would a spamster deploy. how would you identify your spamster? And we started building that um in intelligence engine on our network itself. When we deployed the solution, the kind of reaction that we got from the customers that was staggering. It was so so overwhelming and it was so overwhelmingly positive that despite the fact that we were not charging the customer, despite the fact that uh there was no monetary aspect attached to it, there was no ARPU uptick. It really was something that um made the customer loyal to the brand even more even more so to the fact that last year we actually changed the tagline of our brand toil the safe network. Uh that also gave us the confidence to keep working on such intervention. It was not a one-stop shop solution that okay fine you've done a good job let's now focus on other priorities. Trust and safety has been a priority for us for the last two years and we want want to keep working on it for the years to come. Uh in all our industry associations on global platforms we've taken this issue up. uh we worked with all regulators the entire breadth of it whether it is RBI, AI, SEBI, DOT, TRI, MHI4C basically trying to find a solution that can bring all ecosystem players together and uh curb fraud at the very initial stage itself. The second part uh that we want to work on is what u I think has been discussed by a lot of other panel members as well that once the fraud has actually happened then what kind of recourse can you give to the customer uh a very interesting fact I had uh that I had read recently was that once a fraud happens at least twothird of the people don't know who to report it to that do you go to the police do you go to DOT do you go to NCP database do you go to Chuck Shu uh or do you tell the platform itself self on which the fraud has happened to you. Tell your friends. So a lot of people just don't end up reporting as well. And there's a lot of social stigma that is attached with a fraud happening to you. So that part is also something that we want to solve but with the rest of the ecosystem and it it gives us a lot of pleasure honestly every time we go to any industry meet any person that we meet and he says that listen I know or I can tell my parents who are elderly that listen if you're getting a nettle warning spam please don't pick up that call at least that's the first line of defense I can tell you so yeah I think that answers to your question uh to yes um about data residing on uh any foreign infrastructure uh that's uh I think the entire India AI conference data resilience or u sovereignity has been a key theme for this entire conference and we're very again as a Indian telecom operator working with a lot of critical sectors we are very cognizant of the risk that that holds so essentially If critical data sets are being hosted on infrastructure that is owned and operated by foreign uh companies, there is a risk there is an inherent risk that is there uh in their operations. So yes uh it's been our earnest request to the government that at least the critical data sets owned by the government should be on an Indian-owned and Indian operated CSPs and there should be some movement some discussions around sovereignity as well. Thanks Bab you wanted to come in. >> Yeah. So I was just going to add on the other point which you know they were asked question. So when calls aren't terminated on the network and they fall short you will get extra capacity on the network. So that's also a way of increasing capacity network. one uh one if I can just reframe the second question a little bit and then Shamina can you maybe take a crack at answering that question and NAT which is what is the role of the government in all of this and are we doing enough in terms of collaboration what needs to happen there on that side of the equation so Shamina and then Nir or Nir and then Shamir >> yeah I definitely think there are market failures in fraud management from a behavioral perspective so there are these behavioral uh pieces these public goods for behavior change that need to be created and the government is best placed to uh create those and serve those through such APIs through such rails because they don't neatly fit in any one organization's kind of scope of work right so so I definitely think uh again I keep on going back to the India stack/ API/rails kind of a metaphor because in my mind that is the best way of getting this stuff out to a lot of points of aggregation which then uh gets you massive of scale hundreds of millions of people uh then being better protected and and being more resilient. Uh so yeah I think a lot of public good behavioral public goods are needed for fraud. >> Yeah I think the I think the um the consideration around um bringing the best to India and bringing India to the world is sort of the thing that I think about. I mean as a daughter of immigrants living in America that's sort of my mo is that I hope that I'm the best of India and I'm hope I'm bringing the best of India back to back here. I think there are technologies because I agree with that. I think there are technologies that require data to stay on soil and that's fair and fine and I also think that the technology allows for that in a way. Um what I think it precludes though is that uh for those Indians who want to uh travel outside of India for those who want to bring tourism to India to the the the fact that you the biggest I think the biggest growth driver for India is going to be tourism over the next couple of years. I think there's a I believe in the sovereignty, but I also believe in the economic opportunity and the market drivers, right? And so I think that the way that we've approached it at Mastercard and also at the Center for Inclusive Growth is that you have to create competitive drivers for a race to the top. Um, you know, we compete on financial inclusion and that's a good thing. um we don't compete for a race to the bottom and I think once you start building that in uh to the market you start to see a different outcome. So if the battle for the Indian consumer is based on data integrity is based on transparency is based on consumer protection we'll take that battle any day of the week but you have to make it a fair playing field. Well, this was a fascinating discussion and if there's one take away from me from this discussion is that we need more of these discussions because the scale of the problem is just too big for us to not address and and talk about. And I and the other thing is that what I've heard is that there are so many different types of solutions already out there. We need to learn from each other. We need to share those solutions. Nina's points on creating more public goods uh and and creating sort of principles around which we we sort of operate like you know not having the customer accountable but you know the accountability needs to lie somewhere but lots to learn lots more to talk about and I'm glad that this uh discussion has started vum so thank you so much panelists and pleasure [applause] Great.
