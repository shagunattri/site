ðŸ‘‹ , I'm shagun, this site is a digital library to share blogs on trending and insighful products, book reviews, guides and more.

Currently working at the intersection of technology and psychology in the product management space and building security products in the B2B space.

My current focus is on AppSecOps to optimize for better distribution, usage, adoption and accelerate growth for ArmorCode.

I now settle with ~~Arch Linux~~ a Mac for personal use and work. I write code at times. My projects are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/shagunattri).
