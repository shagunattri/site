### Tips for Better Passwords.

Recently in my intership with Sennovate,I am writing a few blogs as a technical blogger regarding some security topics and tips for the internet.This one is about passwords.In a few points I have discussed about the tips I would give anyone for a better making a better password/passphrase and Internet Hygiene.So check it out and let me know if there are any other points you would like to add upon that I missed.

__For better passwords:__

- `Firstly use passphrases instead of passwords`
    - It is good to have a strong password for your accounts,but for the  security consious users using passphrases instead of passwords is better as it help in easy retention of passwords.
- `Make it Long`
    - Always have long passwords/passphrases to make it harder for attackers to guess and brute force your account.
    - Make sure that make the passwords it is always easy to remember but hard to guess.
- `Ensure High Entropy`
    - High entropy resolves to higher order of randomess necessary for a good password.
    - High entropy ensures that is password is hard to crack and makes the pasword/passphrase strong.
    - One way you can improve entrpy of password is by replacing standard letters with numerals or special characters and make an informal language of your own.
    - One tool that helps you do this:https://github.com/s0md3v/Locky
- `Enable Obfuscation where you can`
    - Obfuscating in simple terms is `the action of making something obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.`
    - Obfuscation merely converts a plain text value into a indiscernible value that is harder to read and will be less likely to be retained by a casual observer.
    - To obfuscate passwords and improve your password strength is good but  one important thing to note is that obfuscated passwords can be hard to remember.

- `Store passwords in a password manager`
    - Password managers are great if you want to store all your passwords in one place and leave the device to remember and store all your passwords.
    - Sounds like a security risk to do so but using good passwords managers does more good than harm.
    - Unix systems have pass(1) which can be used as a password manager.
    - There are many good cross-platform passwords managers that will do all the heavy-lifting for you to better secure your accounts online.
- `Make it unique and easy to remember passwords`
    - It is key that your passwords are unique,easy to remember and hard to crack.
- `Do not include personal info`
    - Passwords are your gateway tokens to access an application and it is necessary for you to make it secure as possible.
    - Using personal info such as your pet's name,your company name and other details will not help in makeing a strong password/passphrase.
- `Avoid REUSE OF PASSWORDS`
    - Be it laziness or bad security practices, never ever reuse passwords application across.
    - If you can't stop the urge to reuse passwords,use a password generator for your help.
- `Update passwords regularly`
    - Set a window to update your passwords and implement a cycle to regularly update passwords.
- `Maintain Internet Hygiene`
    - Having a good Internet hygiene is essential to reduce risks for a hack on your account.
    - Only use sites that you trust and are valid.
    - Always look for site certificate to avoid phishing attempts and reduce the risks of a passwork breach.
    - Use temporary mail service for use-and-throw accounts on sites that you don't use often.
    - Eg temp-mail.org
    - https://github.com/s0md3v/ote
- `Use HTTP(S) enabled sites`
    - Always use sites that have HTTPS connection enabled and only enter passwords in HTTP sites if you trust the concerned stakeholders and site operators.

A refined version of this topic will also be posted on the company blog which I will link to when it is posted.
