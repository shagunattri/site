uh he's a practitioner really implementing this approach to unlock uh opportunities for the youth and women on the ground. So we'll be talking to him about that. Uh then we have uh Shri Madanpadki who is a managing trustee of herald high foundation a foundation whose work has been significant in terms of unlocking many opportunities for youth for converting youth into entrepreneurs and so on and so forth. So we'll have Madun uh talk about that. And incidentally we realized that Madan and Shirram were roommates uh at college. So he's John and I had no idea by the way. Right. So this is serendipity. This is the magic of discovery uh which we are going to talk about shortly. Uh so Shiram he's a partner at Deote and uh he's been involved in terms of you know talking about how u uh approach like this can really benefit folks in the economy and ultimately the citizens in this context. So without further ado, I'll just uh you know get started with that. >> But thank you everyone for being there and once again uh is it working now? All right. So, um I know there's a tagline for this session unlocking India's demographic dividend and how blue dots to the power of AI can be the digital rails to do that. Uh so uh little bit about the idea of the concept in terms of what we'll be talking about. But uh I think we have heard a couple of very uh popular narratives in the context of employment in the context of the demographic dividend of the country it's uh which is youth one which has been about the fact that India uh is struggling with the jobs crisis we need to have many many more jobs and so on and so forth. Uh second that uh while we do have uh the demographic dividend but it's is it a dividend or a liability and uh we talk about a skills crisis in that context that probably we're not preparing our youth to pick up uh the relevant skills which can ultimately uh you know lead them to be employed by the industry. uh but I think uh you know there's a missing narrative also in this context and that's something that we'll surface as we uh talk about this which is that uh uh there are enough and more youth in the country there are enough and more uh avenues for them to pursue their dreams in the country but the two are not digitally discoverable and that creates a discovery crisis. Uh in fact just think about this that uh you know all of us can see uh blue dots of uh uh different options around us right from you know places of interest to finding cabs to finding restaurants but can you find jobs around you as a blue dot? Can you uh find uh you know tourism experiences around you as a blue dot? Can you find uh you know many other aspects that are important in your life around you as a blue dot? uh and and that's the thing that we'll speak about that when you enable uh discovery to be addressed in that context that opens up many avenues in fact uh there are pilots on this which are happening uh in Gaziba Jet Abhinav G is leading likewise in Dhar in Raji and at a few other places which will be shortly starting that but what that is revealing is that uh the moment you make uh uh you know the the the youth the people as blue dots and you uh make uh the opportunities be it in the context of livelihood welfare schemes etc as blue dots that's really starts changing the discovery game and with that discovery game will a lot of aha factors come up and we'll shortly be discussing that so so just to kick it off uh uh man I wanted to ask the first uh question to you uh we of course talk about uh you know the uh the aspect that India may or may not have the right capability. But uh is it true that we have a capabilities gap or is it really you know discovery as a gap which stops us from the seeing the capabilities of people and especially with a initiative that you're leading uh which is around uh creating purple dots for people with disabilities and uh almost one lakh plus have been created uh you know very recently. So how do you see uh this as a problem? I mean is that a problem of capability or are we really missing out on something which is pointing to the problem of discovery in the country. >> Uh thank you Goro G and a very good afternoon. I think uh it's not a problem of capability. India does not lack the ability but what India lacks is the the the source of visibility or basically discoverability like you call it we have through seen through our government schemes and this could be typical of any government scheme across different ministries there's always a whole framework that we put in we have a lot of standards that it matches uh these check boxes only then you are eligible for that particular scheme. And many of times many funds remain unspent primarily because we are unable to find the exact um person fitting those particular check boxes that we call as eligibility. But besides them there's a huge cohort of people who are sitting there ready to be discovered like you put it and I think um it's that visibility that we are looking through and uh this is the time that we are um need to uh use AI and technology in the best possible way to identify that cohort of people who may not as like I said fall into that framework of a government scheme but they does Yet that does not mean that they don't have the aspirations, the capabilities, the talent, the ability that what they lack is the visibility from the government perspective. But then government is not the only provider to match their aspirations. The government can also you with the use of smart AI and technology platform bring their aspirations to match with a set of people who are willing to contribute to that. And I think that's what the purple dot/blue dot and today I've heard an orange dot is talking about, >> right? Orange dot. Yeah, that's a new one. Uh, no, thank you for articulating that. In fact, what you're bringing out is the fact that uh uh we we don't really uh have a problem in terms of having people with aspirations or having livelihood avenues uh avenues for scaling, avenues for you know different types of services or welfare schemes. uh the real thing is to make it surfaceable, discoverable and that's where AI with its ability to uh convert uh intent into voice into a signal that really can be a game changer. >> You know we are a very aspirational country at this point of time. We talk about the democratic dividend. That dividend comes with it with with it with coming with a lot of hope and a lot of aspirations. And I think we need to give a voice to each one of them and that can happen only when we open doors windows whether it has to be physically done or digitally done but we need to do that. >> Excellent. So AI giving voice in a way to the youth to the women to the aspirations of people people with disabilities and that coming out. Thank you. uh Abinav G uh uh you're really doing it on the ground in ter you know enabling this in Gaza in fact uh we got to know about you know how in just the last couple of months you've been able to surface so many local jobs for the local people of Gazibad right so so what is this approach telling you from a practitioner's perspective as you see many local job options being made discoverable for the local youth local women of Gazabad and how do you see this moving from there? >> Uh see when we uh look at the uh entire ecosystem of uh this employment uh we have many stakeholders. Uh for example you have uh uh the employment exchange which is having the database of all the uh aspirants who want to get job. Then uh we have the poly techchnic ITI skill development mission UP skill development mission as in state uh mission uh which are skilling youth in certain skills which are required in the market. Then we have the industries which are the job providers and all these stakeholders they are working under different ministries under different departments and uh when we see this entire ecosystem nobody thinks of it under one umbrella when we see it at the uh district level and this is where the discovery part comes into picture and the use of AI comes into picture uh where what we did was uh to enable this AI based technology or AI based discovery uh we brought all these stakeholders together uh under one umbrella which was jobs facilitation center which we formed at the district level and all these departments and all these stakeholders they were brought together and uh they were made to uh exchange the database they were made to exchange the information for example uh Gazyabad Gazyabad has uh 2.5 lakh registered MSMES and obviously an official also much more than many more than that uh so when we talk about 2.5 lakh MSMES that means Means we are we are we are as in having too many jobs if if I if I even average it like five per MSME you can see the numbers which is huge >> and when we used to conduct the offline mailers numbers used to be 2500 3500 5,000 at max at max which we went at a CM's event was 5,000 not not more than that >> so so getting these many jobs surfaced was a task especially having any offline offline setup and all these departments working separately >> right >> because when I just just just an example for example I used to you know ask these employment exchange officer key are you tell me how many uh students you have been able to reach out or these aspirants have been able to reach out uh who will be coming to the employment so the usual answer used to be sir 8,000 10,000 out of those hardly 50 60 person used to turn up at the mea >> so but when we started this blue dot because this was the vision behind all that. So we we made sure that all these GFC members they sit together. We had multiple meetings with them and uh we made sure that the district industry center which is responsible for handling all the MSME issues. Uh we made sure we we held all the meetings with industrial associations get all these MSMES on this platform ask them to uh create the blue dots in form of job providers on this platform. number one uh that's how we uh created more than 10,000 jobs in last uh 60 days >> uh where we met almost 10 to 12 industries association where obviously held high andep both of them did really well because held high team was there because you know that key you you need to really you know motivate the staff down and and that's why we needed the help of someone like Herald High to you know push it uh and uh that's how we created 10,000 jobs and when it came to job seekers we were finding it difficult to uh you know register the students for example we also had the higher education officer uh in this JFC >> but he or she was not able to basically generate those many numbers because they didn't have any database of the elimin >> for example because these local colleges they don't have this concept of elimin association or or even maintaining a database of those students who have already graduated or even they don't have any idea if they're employed or So uh so in that sense in that sense what that's where the AI chatbot came into the picture and AI AI bot rather calling bot >> and uh we were amazed that key when we use the same database which employment exchange had say 8,000 data was with the employment exchange almost 24,000 data was with the uh skill development department >> right >> uh so almost we had the data of 30 30 to 40 40,000 students for the job seekers, >> right? this AI bot what it did was it called or called all these students >> and we were able to you know generate 10,000 blue dot as job seekers >> seekers right >> uh on this platform with the help of AI bot >> and that is where even even this was a revelation for me also even I I never thought you know a ch a bot a calling bot can do so many things >> in fact when I was discussing the same same with Adar gi uh yesterday. So he mentioned that we have a step in step three also. I was amazed. The next step would be like the bot will be asking you >> okay what exactly do you need as in what skills you want to get skilled >> into. So then we'll be bringing in the other partners, other stakeholders of the ecosystem for example the staffers, the placement agencies because these msmemes they always used to approach the local placement agencies to uh get the staffed but now imagine all the placement agencies of Gazyabad or say locally all the so Nida or Mirat. So all the placement agencies, staffing firms, is skilling centers, iskilling uh as an agencies, they all will be on the same platform and we'll be you know create we'll create a ecosystem which has been so dispersed uh at this time. So this was the experiences. >> No, excellent. Uh that's amazing. In fact just for perspective I also wanted to share that uh uh when you look at the conventional job platforms like nori upna you know all of these uh everyone put together could not even show 100 jobs in Gazad right and what a gi is talking about 10,000 plus jobs and I think that came out of just thousand odd msmemes for each job >> yes yes yes right so only through associations >> only through associations approaching them and we talking about two and a half lakh msmemes in Gaza >> so Does India really have a jobs problem? I think the answer lies in what uh he's been trying and how AI gave voice to people uh so that the jobs can become a bu dot so that people can see around that and vice versa. But Madan now uh >> and can I button before you speak with Mr. Madan and a request to Abhinav and his entire team and probably the headhel high foundation who's working with the the Gazyabad authority is that while you do this um head hunting exercise for so many unemployed youths and along with Msmemes there I think the requirement is also to ensure that you reach out to the PWDs there um and that data can be of course it is already with you If you have an integration with the UD um UI UDID database, you will be able to identify the PWD youth there. And when you have MSMES there, anybody willing to take up a PWD and give them the skill sets along with whatever you need, we'll be happy to help you if you required SOPs for uh the hearing impaired or for the vision impaired. We have other organizations here um uh who work in that field like UniKi and Gopal Krishna and all the others. We'll be happy to join in this exercise. But my deep request to all of you is that when you take on the youth, don't forget the the youth that are with disabilities in this entire exercise. >> Excellent. Excellent. >> In fact, we have ma'am 15,000 specially abled people registered under UDID scheme. Yes, >> ma'am. So 15,000 purple dots hence can happen in Ghana. >> Yes, definitely ma'am. In fact ma'am we had a we we uh did a small project with the IOCL and uh one of the one of our as I'm from IT Madras man as an I graduated from IT Madras. So one of my senior had they have a startup. So uh we collaborated with Neomotion and ICL and we got them placed in Zumato also. So Zumato has service delivery partners. >> Zumato has 2500 PWDs working with them. >> Excellent. So we these are just examples that can be emulated by MSMES and trust me these people are better workers they're more sincere they are they they adapt well and but the only thing that's required is a SOP for them and on job training so that they're uh they they don't the attrition rate is lower they are aware of what they are getting into >> yeah though that becomes important >> uh so so that's an excellent point in terms of how people with disabilities can participate and thank Thank you Abhinav G for accepting that request. Uh uh Madan. So uh G you have to head out right? >> Huh I know. So but request made request accepted. So at least that part will be taken care of. >> Action items. >> All right. So Madan I'll ask the question to you. Uh Abanab G. Thank you. I think you have to leave for an important meeting but thank you for being here. really appreciate it. Thank you. >> Uh Madan, so uh you've been a u you know advocate of blue dots. Uh you've been working with the ecosystem across different implementations. Uh I just wanted to ask you what do blue dots really mean to you and what are the kind of use cases that come into your mind when you think of something like blue dots especially those linked to unlocking India's demographic. Thank you go and fascinating to hear the comments and the thoughts. Now I was just reflecting as I was sitting here the discoverability as you said blue dots help discover two roommates after a long time but I was just thinking see my dad used to run a travel agency. So when I was growing up uh you know 8th 9th 10th grade I used to go and do all the coordinations on phone and somebody calls and say cab driver has not come then you then you call that guy by the time you call this fellow the cab driver is somewhere else. >> It used to be such a nightmare trying to get the addresses going and then came Uber >> many years later. It changed the whole perspective that you look at a problem and say if you apply tech >> uh what emerges >> and I have wondered many times saying that it's such a simple idea why did it why didn't it strike anybody right and Uber then went on to obviously you know spawn the many many billions of dollars of the inter the inflection point that we are at today is that the blue dot as an example is that it gives us it not just gives us it forces us to reimagine the way things work right and if we don't reimagine we will be still stuck in the old world right so the whole concept that uh we've been talking about is that if you use four forces and and man was talking about the whole aspirations and I truly believe that unless and until aspirations are are understood and and packaged and catered to adoption won't happen >> so you take aspirations you take youth power which head and I we've been doing it for 15 years and you take entrepor al resilience that exists in bhat and you take technology you combine those four forces >> uh you can create a new rural and I call that as ruben and therefore rubonomics >> right >> so to me the AI part and the blue dot and the DPI is that can you what can you do to give the power of uh DPI to the power of AI to the youth >> right you said blue dots to the power of AI I'm saying there is a youth power add the DPI power and the AI power to it >> the net effect can be exponential >> right well been discussing the blue dots uh on the purple dots and the orange rots. Uh the the beauty of AI is hyperpersonalization, right? >> Uh so instead of just conceptualizing blue dot today as a point in time, >> what if the blue dot grows in size and and colors >> uh in the journey of the youth? Right? Right. So, one of the things that we hear and and this we keep talking to our recruiters to to say from the lens of a youth uh attrition is not a bug, it's a feature. >> Because if I'm a youth from a from a tier four, tier four, tier three town, I've started working in hotel, I don't like it, I'll quit and try something else till I settle down. >> Right? So, how do you make that feature better that how do you help youth career discover what they're good at, do it faster, right? Can you give them more opportunities as they go along? So this whole aspect of leveraging the power of youth to explore many economic opportunities and not just economic opportunities, social opportunities that bring them dignity. >> Right. >> Right. One of my biggest lessons in Hela has been that well we keep saying and I'm sure ma'am you'll see this in the work that you do that it is not just a job it is the social dignity that it provides. That's why the name we call is a head held high >> that where the mind is without fear and the head is held high right and and money is a byproduct of that >> so I think it gives all of us an opportunity for all sections of the society to really think how do we bring the power of economic empowerment and social dignity >> right >> and how do we amplify it through this blue dot revolution >> right >> uh that is the thought that I have and it can go in any number of directions that we that we will will >> right >> and I think that's the opportunity ahead of us. >> Excellent. So and and you spoke about you know power of AI youth and entrepreneurial ability and of course you know reimagining and all of them put together I think it really >> uh helps paint a wider campus versus you know what the uh in terms of the art of the possible correct and the art of the possible can be in the social context economic context. So coming to economic context uh Shiram this is a question to you uh that uh you know of course if blue dots can power discovery through a variety of use cases to unlock India's demographic uh dividend what does it mean from a economic sense if you were to specially look at the markets and how the markets will look at it and what does it do for them? >> Sure. Thanks Goro. I think um we talked about the concept we talked about the need ma'am you talked about it you know madan eloquently talked about the concept of uh you know four-legged stool and how you can put stuff on top of it at the end of it all of this have to drive the growth of uh the heart of India which um lives in its villages or where nobody in this room is sitting and u you know living on a day-to-day basis and what we have realized when you're talking to many such uh clusters is that keep aside the uh emotional aspect of social dignity and uh you know uh creating a generation of people who have come out of the shackles of whatever we want to call it oppression. The basic fundamental is uh money in the pocket >> right? How do you ensure money in the pocket for a person um sitting at a a very rural village in say some corner of India? We talked about discoverability. We talked about inclusivity. We talked about all of those things. But one more thing that we really need to think through apart from blue and orang is the kind of uh self-help groups and people that are sitting in villages with who are typically not represented or under reppresented. What happens is most of the time their circle is very small in terms of the people who know about them, the people who want to discover them. While blue dot as a concept we are talking of hyperlocal value discovery and not talking about fulfillment we'll come to that later. Uh there is also a merit in terms of looking at uh not from the context of blue dot growing and uh longitudinal life of a blue dot but blue dot itself transmitting its signals beyond the district or beyond the hyperlocal area it was supposed to do. uh some PWDs may find it difficult to move beyond a certain area but there are certain other PWDs who are actually uh mobile as well uh now how do we really figure that out across a certain geographical boundary will really unlock significant value that will perhaps not unlocked if it's a smaller geographical boundary number one number two uh there is something that every single person in rural household has to offer And more often than not it is kind of restricted because of multiple conditions be it societal be it uh geographical or if I dare use the word cast specific considerations or whatever the multiple considerations. Now people who want to consume those services are all not able to find that out and not able to democratically reach out to them uh in a digital manner. So what this blue dot thing would do is to not just discoverability from the position of a person who's giving but discoverability from a position of a person who wants to consume >> that discovery >> will significantly alter and when the fulfillment part of that becomes a zero personal touch you know I don't care who gives a zomato packet at my home right and if that person is not able to speak also but he the moment he brings the or she rings the bell and gives me a foot packet, I'm happy. Right? So that that will significantly change the entire dynamic. That's point number one. Point number two is how do we really exponentially create a scale so that it be can it can become self- sustaining. that creating of scale from self self-sustaining perhaps I would submit that we really need to move away from the fundamental aspect of blue dot which is hyper local to a larger wider canvas so that the data that is getting captured can also start getting transmitted. So you're creating cohorts of insights coming from certain areas which can get transmitted and then you can perhaps create a a cluster a food cluster or perhaps a a small cluster of weaving cluster or whatever in terms of what people are buying a job cluster. So all of those things can spawn out. So what I am seeing as this whole blue dot conversation we'll come to technology later is to is a per not just a movement but something that can really scale out and change the way uh the Indian rural economy can be uplifted and integrated to mainstream that integration to mainstream is what will happen when this blue dot moves out of a hyper local into a hyper non-local I don't know what the right word you want to use into into a larger wider arena And uh no thanks Shirram for sharing that because uh what you're pointing out is that one can think of blue dot not just from the perspective of livelihoods and welfare but also services and services that people would like to consume uh which are actually around them but are digitally dark and hence cannot be figured out right so and I know that a team uh of yours which is working on calculating some economic impact uh actually was telling me a number like uh you know thousand plus kes that can be added to an economy like Nagpur itself if one were to take up diverse use cases of blue dots uh that that's also a possibility right in fact sorry one other thing to add and maybe Sham that's something that the team can look at as well see if uh from a $4 trillion economy if you want to move towards a 30 40 whatever trillion dollar economy in the next 25 years or 20 years uh per capita has to grow almost like 10x right so is it possible for us to work backwards to say if we have to achieve that per because finally what matters is per capita uh GDP per capita right so if you can work backwards to say where is that 20 lakhs of additional value going to come from >> right and and how does that get unlocked at every household level uh using this tech if we can find that correlation answer >> then we can shape the tech to this >> no no absolutely >> no I I a funny incident right um I have certain food preferences. Now I live in a apartment complex which has got 500 houses. I need people who can serve me that food preferences when um you know when I need for example there's a small WhatsApp group that says and then people who start like this suddenly grow >> right now this is happening in a place in an apartment complex where people don't know the neighbor >> correct >> think of what it will do in a village or in in a in a town in a small town so that is what will unlock a significant value discovery from both sides. >> Yeah. >> Right. And an ability to broadcast that I have certain thing to offer >> and where that broadcast is reaching nobody knows but if it's captured digitally somewhere and I have something very cool like a very simple app to consume that broadcast >> then value unlock will happen significantly. >> Yeah. >> Right. So that is one part. The other part is also now with whatever I'm reading about ma'am you know a significant amount of neurodeiversity is also getting added into the workforce. >> Yes. >> Right. And some of these blue collar economy and whatever you're trying to say we can also tag some blue dots as some special special uh skills or whatever. Right? If you want somebody to do repetitive task again and again and again you know people in certain area of the spectrum can do it much much better. So it's perhaps an intersection between a blue and a purple. You have to invent a color so that that you can really figure out what what exactly that you can do >> colors of the rainbow shoe. >> That's what you're talking about. Rainbow has enough colors and to go after that. But I just wanted to now come back to you G. Uh which is see if uh I think we all somewhere know that you know something like this has power to unlock uh not just the demographic dividend but also economy also social capital and so on and so forth. Now if this were to be let's say to be done into in the top 100 plus districts of the country >> to begin with >> uh what do you think can be the role that the government can play to facilitate such a move because of course it's not something that only government should do but the whole circar samaj bazar has to come together to do it but what do you think can be the government's role in facilitating this >> um so we all agree that discoverability or hyper local discoverability and then the ability to broadcast that [clears throat] that capability ability uh to to whoever is willing to take on that talent or provide a service is a done thing. I think the role of the government is to create that u like a digital public infrastructure stack >> like it's done in the case of Aadhaar. Um it is shown in the case of UPI which is okay and we are also exporting that kind of technological intent and learnings to other neighboring countries in the global south. So provide that open infrastructure but it is standardized um it is reliable because that's where the government will come in. uh to tell both ends of the spectrum the people who need to be discovered and are discovered and to people who are willing to be providing that service that this is u a reliable and a standardized method and you can trust it. I think that's where the most important role of the government would come in. Um and I think when we worked with Astep and to did did that pilot project in um Patna and in Harido, we did realize that um there were a lot of people who were willing to provide service or provide donations or CSRs. Uh but they kept coming back to our foot soldiers to tell them. So there is a lot of people who are waiting to be discovered and there are larger number of people who are waiting to give provide it could be cash it could be uh services it could be aids it could be any kind of thing but that matchmaking if it is done on a government open reliable public infrastructure that would lead to a game change and I also want to add a question relating to one of the comments said that um the moment we stop looking at um discoverability or finding that bichara pwd or rural poor living in 70% of our poor living in our villages we need to stop looking at all of this from welfare economics move it more into inclusion economics trust me uh 200 million population is what thinks that also conservatively are the PWD population in my country the census has talked about 26.8 eight something we far know that there is they are much more because the number of neurode divergent cases um people accept them to be of I mean having that so-called disability is also invisible they've kept it hidden >> now this is a large economy so the commercial sense of providing services for them should is what we should project instead of being a welfarebased medical model of inclusion That's what I want to stress on. >> I have one submission on the role of government. Yes. Having spent a lot of year advising governments >> is that somewhere when we are trying to scale out these kind of initiatives, there are pockets of excellence. Gazyabad is a pocket of excellence. Dharawad is a pocket of excellence. Taking the pocket of excellence into a scalable model, governing and orchestrating that is perhaps a role that only government can do. How muchever private sector wants to do uh governing orchestrating then at later point in time certain legal aspects will come in policy interventions have to come into picture all of that there has to be some kind of a government intervention to really scale this out and that while the IT part of a digital public infrastructure is something that can be created by a technocrat easily this governance of the DPI and scaling out from pockets of excellence into a wider scale out is is a critical role that um in my uh submission government should also play. >> I agree. I completely agree. >> Right. U in fact our time is not up. This is what I've been told. We It's not up. I've been told we can continue for a little bit more. Uh sorry. We see the screen which says time up which you may not be seeing but I've just told we can continue for a bit. Uh so uh know Miji very well articulated in terms of you know this uh government can play the role of enabling digital public infrastructure rails for everyone to play upon and I think Shiram you adding to that that you know not just the technology aspect but also maybe envisioning aspect seeing how the ecosystem can play together in that context uh what are the guidelines rules of the game uh etc etc uh so I think that's very very important so actually wanted to take that question to both of you Madan and Shirram as uh stakeholders of both Sam and Bazar in a way if that were to happen how do you envision that something like this getting implemented in 100 plus districts of India what do you think will change as a result of something like this >> there's a slightly different view that I'll take to what uh Sidam is saying >> and and being his roommate of course No, the point is uh I think it is a juggle bundi. It is it is as you said the orchestration and in a juggle bundi or an orchestra uh everybody has to come together. >> Uh where I'm also coming from is and that's the uh you know we've all a part of this uh uh at the India summit we've uh kind of brought together a collaborative called Jen AI saying what India needs is not just more of geni but geni that how do you take AI to the masses. Our learning has been that uh unless and until the the people at the ground feel comfortable feel that this is useful to me and feel that I can trust this and if something goes wrong somebody is there for me >> uh if that is not happen then the whole antio concept will not happen right even in UPI I've actually stood outside thousands of rural stores uh through the teams and and understood why are people not producing it and the biggest challenge they said if I have paid 30 rupees to somebody if it doesn't go he says it's not come I said it's gone who's resolving this for me and I don't want to there's no call >> all that friction have a speaker box which was an important >> which was an important so I think especially as AI takes shape into the uh into the grassroots how do we create structures together that brings that use case specifically tailored for them brings the comfort and the trust to say that listen I can use this without fear And that has to be very focusedly done. else we can all sit here and say I have the best of solutions I do that this but finally at the ground if it's not going and getting used and the economic benefits are not acrewing >> right then there's no use right so I think especially a moment like this requires more in-depth conversation of the samaj bazaras to come together to figure out how do we design the systems in fact u you know I met somebody who runs the the British government apparently has a has a behavioral nudge team >> that weighs in on every policy decision that the British government takes and say what are the behavioral nudges that are required >> to make this happen. How do we design that into the system itself? >> Excellent. >> Right. Especially in the world of AI and new tech coming in, we need more than ever these behavioral nudges uh to play. I mean Swatch Bharat mission was such a wonderful behavioral nudge. >> Yeah. >> Right. So what can we learn from lessons like that or the pulse polio eradication program that was done by rotary was a large large moment >> incredible India absolutely so I think it requires us to think from that angle for a faster adoption >> absolutely well said in fact just wanted to point out that also you know when we talk about any large scale transformation transformation is about change in the lives of people >> change is the hardest thing and what we are expected to change is our behavior Right. So hence figuring out how we reduce frictions >> uh and create value both in economic and social terms for people is becomes very very important as that happens. Yeah, Shira. >> So, where do I imagine this getting to? Right. Uh, so let's let's go back, step back a bit, right? When Facebook came in, I didn't have a Facebook ID. Then somebody said, "You should get into Facebook and create an ID." I said, "Why should I do it?" said you'll know all your classmates. You'll be able to talk to them. So, it kind of fulfilled an unfulfilled need of uh uh getting to know long-lost friends and uh telling that maybe life let's talk about it. Then that was not sufficient. Then Insta came, right? Then it became more and more talking about this is what is happening in my life today. Today, right? Then Snapchat came. It not happening in life today, it's happening now. So I there's a need to broadcast and get that self uh self validation ma'am. Yeah, absolutely. That's the right word, right? And and then others also felt the need. Then it kind of reached a critical mass and it grew. Now what I would see in this is in a future world assuming you know all the frictions are eliminated um through government orchestration or uh a juggal bundi orchestration uh whatever it is u this would this has the potential to not only discover and fulfill but also start integrating value exchange right the more currently we are looking at discovery discoverability and fulfillment of skills versus jobs. Now tomorrow you add a training center into it. Then there is exchange of money. You add a scholarship providing CSR initiative. Then there is exchange consideration of uh who to do what to do. Then slowly you start building the profile of blue dot. You know blue dot will get multiple flavors right now. This is the it how do you make it trustable? >> Then the fact that I have worked I'm a it pass out. I'm a welder. I I have a physical disability of XY Z and I worked with this MSME for 2 years and like somebody said my interest is to move out of the village into a town into a metro and then earn say 50,000 a month that the fact that this person has had the skill verifiability of that the longitudinal trust around that whole thing can we start embedding into blue dot. So when these things slowly start happening, this whole blue dot has the ability to become a value exchange, a discovery, uh perhaps a monster or a a LinkedIn of the future. It could also become an Amazon of the future. It could become an urban company of the future. All of this is possible. But the key question that remains is how do we show the first few examples that are really successful? And as a country sorry for saying this my personal opinion not deoits we are very poor in um uh tomtoming our successes saying that you know we have done this we have done this really well this works so please others emulate us so how do we take the best examples of a Gazyabad or a dharad and really get it into a mainstream conversation right and if there are 10,000 uh you know pwd in gazibad who got employed with this how do we run a campaign so that you know five other districts would want to pick that up. So all of those things have to come together to really imagine the future that we have. Friction is not just in technology. Friction is across adaptability and adoptability both. >> Yeah. No, that's uh very well articulated Shirram because uh I think you're just uh not just talking about the fact that technology is one aspect but behavior and in that context what are the different use cases of this right which is uh because as an individual I have different aspirations different needs uh how does the blood continue with me in that journey evolve in that journey uh become something which I can use for many many different types of exchanges that I need to do in the context of my needs and aspirations. That's a very very powerful way of looking at it. Now coming to diverse use cases. Final question just like 30 30 secondond kind of a response. Uh if you were to really see a use case expand and become big in the country in this year in this year 2026 what would be your choice? Please uh can uh give your reaction. >> I'll go first because again I will speak again from the point of view of persons with disabilities. My use case would be to to unlock that potential that they have waiting there to be discovered that they are um an individual who have the power to economically um give to the GDP of the country. They are uh an commercial base a marketplace which has not been discovered. We need people to provide both goods and services to them and that they their participation becomes a matter of default not a matter of uh programs like purple dots to discover them. It should become default and all this in the entire envelope of inclusivity at the basic design uh from birth till the end of the cycle. Thank you. >> Well, beautiful Shiram Mad. My I I I I I think I touched upon it. I didn't uh delve into it. It's all about u you know hyperlocal value discovery. The killer use case for me would be local uh self governance right uh and there you don't need significant governance from because there are enough punches and all of those who are governing. So how can we really get this local economy blooming through the SG? Why I'm using the word SG again is one there are certain people who are skilled who get formal education they go to ITA they go to 10th 12th etc there is a bunch of people who are denied even that in in some villages where people cannot go for education how do we bring them into mainstream s is the key thank you >> one word msmemes how do we unlock the power of msmemes I think it's a ripe for disruption >> excellent I'll pray to god tonight that all your you know use cases come through during this year. Thank you so much uh to all of you for being present here and once again apologies for the delayed start but I hope you enjoyed the conversation and had some good takeaways. Thank you everyone. Look forward to working. Thank you. [applause]
