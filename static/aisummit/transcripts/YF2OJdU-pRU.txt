services and how institutions are evolving towards autonomous operations. >> Thank you. >> I don't have slides. >> Good afternoon. Am I audible? Awesome. Once again, good afternoon. And first of all, I would like to extend my thanks to business next for uh providing this opportunity to speak to this August audience. The topic today is very apt and uh you know AI adoption to autonomous banking building trust scale and inclusion. You know as a matter of fact uh I was thinking about this topic and I was speaking to Nishant who is the CEO of business tax who will be joining us in few minutes. This topic applies to literally any industry, right? I mean, you can think of, for example, beyond banking, if you were to apply to manufacturing, we are already talking about lights out manufacturing or dark factory as they call it, right? In data centers, there's already sort of dark data centers where you really don't have to do anything and most of the work is taken care of by either the tech or very soon uh some physical robots as well to change the the devices etc. If you take that analogy further, you can probably you're seeing the lot of thing happening even in agriculture right so you can imagine not exactly a lights out farming because probably plants won't work but u automated farming which we are seeing a lot of examples of similarly in healthcare retail and everywhere but one thing that we have noticed and we have been thinking about this uh topic a lot for many years now not not just after the advent of AI in fact in 2021 As we started looking at different technologies which are constantly automating every aspect of our life, every of the you know each of the workflows that businesses usually deploy. We are seeing that deployed in at a very significant scale now but it's been happening for some time. In fact, there is certain consistency that exists across industries. And just to give you an example, if you look at any industry and if you look at any customer that's a consumer or the customer of that industry, they all follow a certain life cycle. They usually discover a need, right? That there is something that they need to buy or consume from that industry that's going to help in their lives. And then that process is also getting significantly automated. Then if you look at exploration of that choices that they need to do for to fulfill that need in terms of what products are available we are seeing a lot of automation there and I'll give you example of banking in a minute the third stage typically is after you have discovered need and explored the choices as you go about buying a product right and then you use it and if you need some help ask and explore and this is just one value chain which sort of consistently exists across whether it's retail financial services within financial services across all the ser verticals like banking, credit card etc. In 2021, we came up with this concept called autonomous finance and that autonomous finance is nothing but a lot of automation happening across like think of it like single strand DNA molecule or you know the the cells sort of emerging across these different life cycle stages of the customer. And now we are reaching a stage where collectively all of these things are coming together and we are inching or moving towards a world of truly autonomous finance. In this world you can imagine the products as you even if you buy a even before you buy a product even if you discover there's a need there's someone who's analyzing your behavior your aspirations your life events and they are triggering some sort of a marketing message which helps you discover there's a need that you have in your life right without you actively looking for it. Then at the next stage as you discover that need that there's already a sort of barrage of maybe messages or some sort of personalized recommendation that you start seeing in terms of the choices that you have without you even having to lift a finger. it's showing up in our smartphones or in the digital spheres that we the frequent and likewise uh there are choices of automated buying automated onboarding and things like that and we are seeing this trend evolve continuously across this as we look into the future what we believe as we move towards this world of autonomous finance there are four things uh that will become really really key for the industry and these three four things one of them you'll probably already start seeing a lot of is what we call as this industry becoming highly invisible right so you will see a lot of service you'll use a lot of services but you truly would not know who's behind it I mean if you look at the credit nowadays sometimes you end up buying credit card you really don't know what's the bank behind it because there's a layer that's being run by someone else right so as we go forward uh we'll see banking becoming even more assistive more agentive and very much personalized and and of course anticipatory right so it will become much much more invisible you will see a certain class of firms which will be controlling the relationship but there's another class of firms which will become highly transactional oriented transaction oriented and you really would not know how many firms were involved in the process of serving your your need that will happen beyond invisible which has already started to manifest the s the banking and the financial services sector will become highly connected and already we are seeing signs of it but you can imagine a world where it becomes even more connected right open banking obviously is a step in that direction that we see now in that sort of world ecosystems and platforms become obviously much much more important and we'll see as we go into the panel some of the discussions around how AI is powering some of these ecosystems how businesses will create uh deliver experiences which is highly connected right? How they're integrating digital and physical touch points. For example, we are hearing about banks which are introducing rings which are used not only for payments but for powering data to for another ind for other industries that they could be connected to such as healthcare right if you look at on the commercial side on theme side there's a lot of flow that's starting to get captured and you can and that data flow is being shared across different participants in the industry and they are delivering services to themes. The third thing be beyond invisible and connected would be insights driven and I cannot overstate the importance of insights driven in a forum which is around AI and uh obviously every insight that we talk about today is going to become even much even more intelligent it'll be generated much more intelligently and banks will capitalize on customer trust to create value from those insight because banks for all we know are or financial services firm in general are the biggest custodian of trust and the bene beneficiaries of the trust and they are the ones who create the trust in the first place. So we'll see a lot of that happening as we go forward with respect to insights driven because all those life cycle stages that I talked about will increasingly get a lot of insights uh embedded into them. And finally and the most important thing which I cannot uh leave today without talking is how banks and financial services firms will become much much more purposeful because in the mele of all the things tech and all the innovation and all the automation you cannot lose sight of the customer and what essentially they value. So we will see customers will rely or rather bank or work with financial services firms who they believe are much much more relatable to them share similar values with them or something someone whom they can trust. So invisible connected insights driven and purposeful these are the four elements which will become increasingly important as we go towards the world of autonomous finance. Now what will you need to uh build or deliver uh build this kind of world? Do we have all the ingredients or the you know the building blocks in place and I would say we are fortunate uh to live uh in a country which is constantly expanding the digital public infrastructure that we have created and that's already powering a large large number of use cases. Obviously we all familiar with UPI and Aadhaar and you know everything else but I'm just want to make it a bit interactive. How many of you in the room have heard of this thing called ULI or unified landing interface? Just by show of hands almost 50% a little bit less. How many of you have heard of this thing called open which is uh which stands for open credit enablement network? Very few. And how many of you have heard of treads? I'm expecting even fewer hands. Okay, I'll just give you an example of how we are ex as a country we are uh expanding the stack that we have created which is so commonly used by people like you and I in our consumer life day-to-day the UPI and everything to say the commercial bankingmemes we have all seen the UPI moment but as we go forward this is another undercurrent of capabilities that are getting built and expanded upon which will be used by people who are in a very different sphere of life for example kana stores or small merchants and thememes etc. And in there we're going to see the concept typical will move from what used to be an assetbacked lending. You know you needed to have some sort of a collateral a land or a property to what we call as a flow-based lending right with amount of activity that you have that you're doing the data that you're collecting will uh give the banks the confidence to lend to you. Do you have for example uh three months of constantly you know uh paid invoices or something that'll give banks the confidence to give you something and that's what we're going to build through these systems. ULI essentially combines all sorts of data for example your uh your land assets your you know um other demographic data and provides banks a complete picture of you as an individual or as as someone who they can extend credit to. Oken makes it possible. You know that's a protocol which allows any digital platform or a commerce app to extend credit openly. And Treads is is even more unique. It's basically helpsmemes to get their invoices paid even before their their buyer is going to pay them. So normally payment terms of t plus 30 or 90 or whatever butmemes can put their invoices up on a system where their buyer can acknowledge that invoice and then uh there are banks which are looking at their system on a regular basis and they can pay thatme money right then and they're improving their working capital situation and then banks will actually be kind of bidding for that the themes will have a choice whether they they get the invoice paid from bank A which is charging 9% interest rate versus bank B which is charging 7% interest rates. So all of that is already starting to happen and TRS is the platform which helps with helps uh do it. So as you can imagine the world around us is getting increasingly autonomous and we have all there uh ingredients and building blocks in place. So this is the future that we are building and today uh as we go further uh business next will share some of those examples as to what they are doing but and then we're going to come on to the panel. So I just wanted to introduce what the idea for the conversation today would be but happy to have conversations as we go forward. So thank you so much and I'm going to hand it over to Anjen to come and talk about his his bit and then we'll start the panel. Thank you. Thank you so much Ashto for your insightful perspective and for setting the stage so effectively and uh now I would like to uh invite all the panelists on the stage Mr. Sharon Ryans uh who's CGM and chief strategy and marketing officer at India Post payment bank he's driving largecale financial inclusion and digital transformation across one of the world's most expensive banking networks and now Mr. Nishan Singh, founder and CEO of Business Next, who is he's at the forefront of building AI powered platforms enabling banks to move forward autonomous banking. And um now to build on that, I'd like to invite Mr. Anjin Pande who's VP of consulting at business next and who works closely with financial institutions on the ground to translate AI strategy into measurable business outcomes. So Anjin over to you. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. Thank you so much. Hello everyone and very good afternoon. I hope the postlance syndrome is not kicking in yet. Right. Can we have a good round of applause for the session? Okay, that's a nice energy. Thank you so much. So uh since we are at the AI summit and um you know the fellow panelists before set a very good context as to how the industry is moving forward to it. uh we had a privilege to work with largest financial institutes across the globe and would like to share a few learnings as to what we have learned over our journey and uh then we'll take the discussion from there. So we are business next and uh what brings us to this sweet spot of AI and Bhat AI is that you know we learn from a million bankers daily. The platform is used extensively to power the financial ecosystem of the country. More than a billion customers interact with the platform daily to do their service transactions or get a product from a bank or a financial institution or resolve a query. Uh the platform is overall driving a huge penetration across the workforce in the financial institutions and is being hardly regarded by some of the leading industry analysts and the big force of the world. uh to bring to a context the platform is curated more than a two decades of learning from learning on the entire BFSI chain not just from the banking but from the insurance industries all the way from India to Southeast Asia to US and all the other perspectives that also brings us to a very unique spot of understanding the regulator activism across each of these areas because as Ashotosh mentioned uh AI with guardrails and ethics is going to be the forefront of this generation. So how does uh as the you know the AI world evolves, how does economies transact from a banking perspective and how does trust guardrails are established is something that we are very uniquely positioned at and uh we are very humbled to be trusted by some of the largest financial institutions in the country and very humbled to power the fintech wave in the country more than two decades back when uh products were really not coming out of India. But you know one of the initial companies to bring that wave build from India built for the world is something that's been the mantra for the company for so long and I think the next slide is very uh special to all of us and we all should take a proud this uh we are the only first Indian company to make on the top you know zooming past all the Silicon Valley players in the financial space and uh you know bringing business next right up on the up as the best CRM stack money could buy today for banks and financial institutes. Uh this is being vetted by forester very special wave. I'm very truly humbled to be here featuring there and we continue to learn more and build more this. But you know what powers us today is u the core philosophy of our company and the vision driving the product is being we understood the fact that products and technologies and business will fundamentally evolve every 3 to 5 years. You know if I just plot 15 years on a timeline I think all the veterans in the hall will appreciate this. When internet was born everybody was building net banking right I don't need to visit bank I can do it from my home. I mean that was the new wave. Five years fast track Steve Jos brings touch and iPhone and everyone was on mobile bank right you know five years fast track you know somebody brings chat GPT and people are saying okay now I don't need to even do mobile you know I can just type and get things done right and we serious sincerely you know thought this vision back in 2018 and we have kept this slide like this and today we are in 2026 and we are exactly talking autonomous banking uh you know because we fundamentally believe that humans will continue to do best what they are good at. That means building trust, relationship, empathy and all the human things while machine should be doing all the things which machine is good at you know fraud monitoring, transaction scanning, you know, fraud detection, cyber attacks and all of those things. So uh this is being the foundation for us to think and put the vision in front of the world. But let me uh delve into a perspective of how do we see the banks of today or the financial institutes of today and how does this this transition will happen over a period of year. So and excuse me I mean this could be a little touchy slide for some of the bankers but you know what we see today banking is you know over so many years banks have added capabilities by buying stacks you know so every now and then when a new regulation or a technology comes there's a bolt-on strategy in banks to go and acquire a product and start building on top of it you know while that leads to you know in some of the inside view of the bank is actually there are too many systems you know complex problems and brittle integrations to solve for it and that leads into you know what we call as data paralysis you know now comes the AI age and how do you train your AI on so many systems of different data types you know and I'm sure some of the bankers here would appreciate that there are still DB2s of the world running in the banks you know while there are some new age cassandra or the click house of the world but there is still DB2 which is somewhere and nobody wants to touch it so you you know how do you bring all of that convergence and bring autonomous and AI becomes a challenge and is a conversation that boardrooms are now trying to drive at but here is the good part that banks that we were trying to fundamentally run you know it was a hard battle for us but we did it so we from the day one started building the product on the what we call as single entity model so we said when banks have to get more capability does not mean the banks have to acquire more systems you know your systems should be self upgrading and learning to keep you on the best stack ever. So you know with that philosophy in mind we built all our capabilities for BFSI keeping the single entity model at the center of the conversation. What that does mean is you know banks that are running with us today autonomously have a data structure on which AI can be fed on or on which the in you know the intelligence can be federated. Now those could be our models, banks model, anyone's models that they want. But this underlying problem is being taken care inherently by the dividend of our technology architecture which is something that you know after so many years Forester could recognize and you know hence the conversation in BFSI. So that's us you know what we bring to the table is solutions around financial services for you to solve your customer pains digital agentic AI and all the other good capabilities. We have a boot down in Tal Hall one more than almost I invite every one of you to visit that stall once. And uh moving on from there, how do we see banks take this shift is eventually the product and channels will collapse in banks. You know today we discuss between the product teams and channels team. What we certainly feel that products and channels will eventually merge. you know I'll talk to a banker and the banker will write my query to a system which will be intelligently given by a principle or the autonomous brain of the bank and my offers and my needs will be catered then and there so what we do what we used to run today running complex segmentations offer churning all of that will be gone I mean we'll be just collapsing products and channels in what we call as the principle which is something that business X is now unveiling first at the AI summit today is to you know what we are building for the future of AI wave to come but uh let's say this being the future let me give you a time plot as to how to reach this generation so as I plotted you the time if you remember you know we started with digital banking what we are now thinking is actually cognitive banking what does cognitive banking means to you is it's not just bolt-on AI models on top of your banking stack It's actually the intelligence systems which are connected by your shared reasoning. So one layer senses something and the other layer responds to address and do an STP on top of it eventually leading you to the autonomous revolution. Let me just double click for you for one minute. What does cognitive banking mean for us? So think of this like a six layer architecture where each and every functional component of the bank is being taken care by an intelligent system. So right from identifying who I am as a customer which is typically your identity intelligence to figuring out what risk I might carry for a particular asset product or a liability product which is your risk intelligence models to figuring out if I'm saying something in human language what is my intent am I looking for a case or a service or a new product and finding out whether I'm contractually eligible to sign a paper for a mortgage lending yes or no that's your contract intelligence eventually leading you to giving me something end of the conversation which is a value intelligence. So it's not just about getting one single model and putting it on your system. It's actually your shared layers of intelligence models acting together like a living wing organism to address to the customer need in a omni channel fashion. So that's what we mean to say by cognitive banking which is the era that is happening today. But let's take a look into the future of tomorrow. What does tomorrow hold for us? uh and if I were to just doubleclick you on what autonomous banking could mean for all of us is there going to be two pillars. One there is going to be as Ashtoh mentioned banks will be invisible and a lot of things will be done by the machine at the same time there still be humans in the loop which will be far more armed and far more informed to have a better and meaningful conversations. So we have broken down into two concepts which is one is your autonomous architecture and the second one which we are calling as a second brain or let's say an augmented banker. So while the autonomous banking architecture will be like a multi-ensory organism you know reading from your call center scripts all the way to making a decision from your principal core which will be feeding from the data which banks today have you know your data warehouses and all the single entities that we've been bringing all the way to bringing to the product processors and while empowering the humans to do what humans are good at which is the second brain architecture here and AI will do basically the grant work you know understanding data patterns compliance monitoring transaction monitoring pattern recognition all of this will be offloaded to AI as a was saying you know somewhere happening in the back end human doesn't care while humans do more human things you know what they are good at building relationships empathy ethical judgments is something that humans will be good at and probably the last slide where you know we sincerely feel that banks will no longer be competing on a better product or a distribution channel. What banks will be competing on is your intelligence density. How intelligent you are across each of these layer. How is good is your institutional memory? How good can you take decisions with trust and scale? And eventually it will not be the headcounts that will give you the growth. It will be the intelligence per headcount that will actually result into what we are going to see tomorrow banks leading into. So with that note I'll take a pause and I'd like to request insights from the panel to build further on this topic and uh in case there are any questions we'd like to take it at the end. Thank you very much. Thank you so much Anjin and we now have a great foundation both from an industry research perspective and the real world implementation experience. I'd like to open the discussion to a broader panel and with such accomplished voices on the stage let's explore what autonomous banking truly means in practice. Over to you gentlemen. >> Thank you. Well uh so I think you have met most of us here well at least two of us here. Uh we are also joined by Gorcharan from Indian Payments Bank. So maybe we can start the conversation with you Gorchan that uh considering that Indian payments bank uh India postp payment bank sorry u has been in in uh in existence for almost four plus years now >> and it's seven years >> uh sorry yeah seven years thank you. uh but it's probably one of the most understated bank which is present in major part of the the hinterlands of the country and many customers are being served by it. So what do you think of this whole movement of the digital to autonomous and and cognitive what exactly is happening at your bank? >> Correct. So um as Nishant has just shown uh we started India Post payment bank on the 1st of September 2018 you know and you know the journey has been uh you know entirely digital you know today uh we are uh amongst the largest banks in a journey of almost 7 and a half years only. Uh today we are proud to say that we have a customer base of 13 and a half cr customers approximately and not even a single paper signed in the bank not even a single application form signed in the bank and today uh you know we are competing on various fields on various parameters and you know we have been pioneers on digitization and you know introducing new products services etc and specially targeted at the people who are unbanked, right? You know, for example, if you imagine a you know, tribal in a in a village in Chhattisgarh or in Andra or or a person living in the far corners of Arunachal or Himachel, you know. So these people uh so far nobody was reaching to them for banking you know and also the other objective uh from the supplier side I would say that the from the government side they were finding it extremely difficult to provide them the sustenance benefits and various other benefits directly to them without any middleman you know they were finding it extremely difficult so what we did was we digitized the whole process Uh we digitized uh the account opening uh and various other products of banking, remittances and payments and uh you know uh bill payments or uh you know insurance and loans, credits everything we digitized and this process was so simple, so intuitive, so reliable, so trustworthy and of course as Nishant mentioned channels merge but our key channel of delivery was assisted and I must say that that assisted channel had an existence in the lives of these people for almost the last 150 years. Right? So they had a trust basis the cost of opening a ka the cost of opening you see that while you are expanding the reach you have to also manage the economy you have to also manage the cost less than four rupees less than four rupees Bankformatform, right? We opened it in 3 minutes and we gave him just a QR card, opened his account and lo and behold, he was ready to bank. We gave him a mobile application. We gave him a virtual debit card. We didn't give him physical debit card. We gave him a virtual debit card. We gave him UPI application. We gave him Aadhaar enabled payment system ATM cash from anywhere in the country. So we gave that and that is how we started because see this is a journey not for people like us who are sitting in the room. We are very technologically savvy. Imagine in our place imagine a person you know let us say our you know mother or our father or our grandparent or maybe our maid or our driver who are not so techsavvy and who don't trust uh you know some application with money to p there is a face and that face that person that physical touch that empathy was provided by the postman and that is how we started. So today out of uh 13 and a half crore customers we have about 5 crore mobile app downloads 5 crore mobile app downloads and today we have uh you know as we are expanding you know we do almost 3 and a half cr you know financial transactions payment transactions on a daily basis and uh you know this is translating to almost 10% growth every month so we are growing at a faster pace than the industry in terms of even UPI. So today amongst all the banks we are the ninth largest and competing with all the existing banks uh in the industry. So uh you know we have various uh laurels to our credit and as these you know conversations also about AI and automation. So we are initially we are strengthening our uh assisted delivery you know assisted delivery by delivery by using u items or stuff like sales scope pilot and people who are doing uh mobile banking uh so in the DIY mode. So we are trying to provide them nudges you know push notifications SMSs to you know buy insurance or you know renew their insurance or you know keep on continue transacting or you know various other offers and incentives that we keep on offering to the customers and also our salesforce. So Salesforce is huge almost 2 and a half lakh people uh who are delivering the service and th that sales force is also automated you know that Salesforce is just having a device uh you know which we have provided them from our own cost that device is a microATM device along with a biometric and uh that device is fully controlled managed through MDM services that is MDM mobile device management services remotely over the air and uh there is the SIM which is provided which is inbuilt into the device. So that delivery channel itself is uh you know is humongous and uh imagine you know Graind Dak Seak who is just about 10th or 12th pass and certify because RBI says banking service deliver through any channel or any person he has to be IBF exam certified. certify and then only he's ready to provide that banking service right then our own products and services localanguage local language. He has to have videos that he can show to the customer in the local language. So all that assistance, all that stuff is being provided uh you know digitally. So that is the you know good part. But the biggest factor now the challenge that is coming to us is the uh risk factors. He's very gullible. He's he doesn't know and he normally you know is dependent on you know the CTO of the house CTO of the house is a childto scheme that was launched by Madhya Pradesh government speaker system recorded message. Post Office Mobile. mobile banking download to 70% of the women they downloaded the appc and in fact chief minister when he heard about it he was really very happy mobile which is the risk. risk monitoring and all these AML activities cyber control and risk control measures investment. So there are processes like uh you know uh there are risk module like RTM realtime transaction monitoring modules. There are processes where we keep on analyzing month on month. We get uh to you know stop the payments, restrict the payments in hotspot areas, restrict the payments for certain people who are doing more transactions, sudden transactions account for example unused unused for the last say 6 months or seven months. Suddenly volume of transaction or suddenly volume and value of transaction suddenly increases immediately we put a curve because we know that some kind of fraudulent activity might happen. So these kind of you know we have certain rules and regulations with which we uh you know apply uh so as to prevent the frauds and uh these kind of things. So with that I think I have spoken great story. So please give a big round of applause for India's post payments bank. Uh besides the the fact that digital and the AI and autonomous one thing it clearly ticks uh mark on is the inclusion. You know that's something we as a country being so diverse and having sort of different stratas of society with the level of education and everything. I think it's great to have the story of inclusion. So thank you so much. I think I'm going to maybe go to you Nishan now because I think you're the only person who stayed silent all this while based on what you've heard so far and you speak to banks in India and banks outside u what do you think is the time frame in which we're going to move from what where we are today and all this AI initiatives and then you have your examples of agents sort of coming in and and getting deployed across different processes what's the time frame with that we need to look at for any bank which is probably looking to set up their or start their journey towards autonomous banking. Maybe in broad stroke from process perspective which processes are more mature, which are less mature, where exactly we'll be uh when it comes to autonomous finance or autonomous banking in say 3 to 5 years time frame. >> Thank you guys. Um okay, so let me break this answer into two parts. Where are banks today? What Anjen built for you was what we call as the start of cognitive banking where intelligence that was in silos is coming together and forming the first ever intelligence layer and there are almost like six classifications of intelligence we do including the risk that server is talking about right now being one of the live counters on that. So where we see today is banks are in the early phase where last year they were deploying a lot of AIdriven use cases. So these are really edge use cases driven by AI largely trying to drive productivity. What we see this year is a rise of agents. So whether it's agents that we run for banks or agents own like banks own team trying to build agents. What you're seeing globally is a shift of consumption from what classically used to be LLM training to inference side and therefore what you're seeing banks today is to not only dealing with one or two agents but in some of our banks we are now starting to deal with fleet of agents which means multiple agents and therefore as you can believe your bottleneck shifts to things like how do you govern this pattern pattern, right? How do you risk and orient this pattern and how do you orchestrate this on scale? So to me, banks are at this place of cognitive banking where you can think of that having three things. One is this intelligence layer that can also execute. Marry that with a proprieter data stewardship which means intelligence of data, intelligence of individuals that kind of really allows that risk spectrum to spread and eventually this orchestration framework that kind of allows this to be done on scale with multiple agents trying to run and finish the job. And we do see over the next three to four years as digital second brains kick in in the bank a lot of what let's say an RM does classically today will start to migrate uh to one instruction set to an agent. So literally we believe 60 to 70% of what you do daily as a grunt work can be migrated to this second second brain architecture. That's what we see in the first 3 months or sorry first three years and I think after that it's a very radical take that we have on autonomous because you know all innovations are compounding in nature. You came up with a wheel and that then enabled automobiles and stuff like that. So now imagine if we had this level of intelligence improving and then you also have an industry that starts to kind of deal in imagine for a minute you had a digital rupee which you have today but imagine if it goes on scale then you have a currency which is programmable also it can be autotagged the the the currency can carry KYC uh imagine a currency like is with an autonomous infrastructure becomes very programmable right therefore the shape of how eventually autonomous banks will evolve is very different so I'll not go into that right now if you have time definitely go back and visit this but I think in the next 3 years expect banks to be a combination of these thing working hard on the unified intelligence layer not intelligence in silos those not intelligence as a bolt-on. The second is the proprietary data. Data warehouses unfortunately are not great places to pull decisions from. Uh single entity model as we describe it where you are live sensing data about an individual. That's what's going to power a lot of this next generation of use cases. And then of course the ability to orchestrate this on scale. Now when you bring all of this you can apply it into any condition because what AI today gives you is a complete multimodal structure. So if imagine the Indian post bank people can now talk to their applications in 11 Indian languages. If you look at how collection calling has started to invert today you have a majority of uh collection callings now happening on a AI based platform. And what is the tuning we are doing? We are not trying to teach it. Let's just take an example. We're not teaching it telu. We're teaching it the dialects of telu now. So that is the compounding effect. So like different districts have different accents and then the finetuning of that. So you're already seeing this. We see this move into a more central governance structure. Today obviously banks are grappling with governance of this because imagine if every application was to bring a LLM voice and all of that. How do you set up a universal guard rail? How do you set up universal uh risk management around that? So again those are things I think which is going to keep banks busy for the next two years. But again very very excited for where we are very excited for India because we are the use case capital of the world. very excited because we live in a country that has built such a spectacular digital public infrastructure and we haven't stopped. We have just got started. So that married with our diversity, married with our pressure of cost per transaction, married with the technology that we're enabling is what has us excited. Thank you. Thank you for that. That's a great answer. So I'm going to build on that a little bit. Um and then I'm going to maybe come come to you with another question and then probably we'll open for the audience to ask questions. So to the examples that you're giving right and they are great for example in conversational banking you're talking about different languages being used to communicate with the people in their vernacular right so all all of that and that's all great however uh for banking to be truly uh become autonomous or for that matter any part of financial services or for that matter any industry right there has to be a lot more personalization uh that needs to happen right so for example if I'm speaking to someone in in whatever language that they speak unless the the conversation also has the elements that matter to them as an individual uh not just because we speaking the same language but what life stage they are in what sort of needs that they have what sort of transaction history that they have so there's a lot of work uh between the agents that that's speaking to that individual and what you have in the organization in terms of the context right and that's where I'm assuming a lot of engineering that need needs to happen today we are obviously all talking about rag and how we inform the models but we are kind of working on this idea around context engineering which is essentially about getting all that data which is sitting in your structured as well as non-structured sources and you engineer them in a manner and build the pipelines to make sure the agents are fully informed of what that particular individual lifestyles but as you do that you mentioned that responsible AI the ethics and all that and now we have DPDP also in place because we want to make sure the the privacy is not sort of breached and other ethical considerations are taken care of. So what are your thoughts on that because u I think we'll be remiss if we don't touch upon like you said the guard risk that the organizations and the banks need to put in place to make sure we are not uh stepping on the in the wrong direction. >> I think that's a very valuable feedback. What's the role of privacy in all of this? Let me just dump it down to that simple right. Um see the very fact that you need to know a person you want to have intelligent conversation means you need to know a lot about it as your question itself assumed these are structures we know about a person and then there comes an act which says I have a right to forget it uh yes you can but where is the world going to the world is going to what we call as the power of one bank uh you don't need a standard product you need a product that is structured to your need how you get paid. Maybe you have a bonus at the end of the year. Everything has to be sharpened not in broad strokes but in one stroke. For that we do need to understand you as a character. Okay. So the AI cognitive structure is very different from a human cognitive structure. So he so so imagine a a AI it can remember almost a million token today in context and it can it can actually draw um deductions uh out of that context not get fatigue and so on. So is it possible to do a power of one banking when you have a right to forget? The answer is yes. We call it archetypes. And in a classical model of of marketing, you try to break segmentation to let's say a segmentation of 15,000. And that's uh let's just say complicated enough if you have 13 cr customers because they will behave like that. So if you kind of think you can put archetypes on steroids, I can still have uh the right to forget data but define you very closely with that archetype and still meet my aspiration as a bank. Uh I think I think right to privacy is very important but I also feel it is hard to implement uh with just a simple jurisdiction. uh look at every place you leave a data trail on. Forget the banks. Banks are probably the most regulated entity where you have a footprint and regulators are always anybody who runs a bank or NBFC knows how hard it is to do an RBI audit or in any other company. So I think the point now is yes DPDB act is important. companies are we are find figuring out ways to respect that but we are also figuring out ways to remember the context in which we engage with you does that make sense >> thank you so I think we kind of touched upon most of the points that we wanted to touch as a panel with respect to the privacy and the inclusion and ethics and everything now maybe we can open up for the audience to ask question or you want to add something yeah sure >> so so maybe not as a question but uh maybe to you Nishan uh of course all the AI thing happening across and you know so much things about AI just from a normal ordinary citizen side what changes for me or any implementations that you may have seen with any public sector bank where AI has given the dividend back to the citizen let's say helping me file my grace or helping me solve something which could have taken me days like sir said you know uh some AI happening around Right. So if you could give a real example for the audience here as to you know what will eventually give back to the citizens as to when banks embrace all of this. Okay that was an unofficial question joking but u no I think that's a very good question like I think what we may be talking may sound abstract 30,000 ft but that's how fundamentally strategies are made and then curated to execute. But look at SBI as a bank. Okay, I'm just picking up SBI because again they have 40 crore customers. Uh that's 40% 30% of India and and one of the biggest way they've used AI with us is basically like uh what we built them was a CR portal. It's a portal that speaks 11 languages. You can come and type in English. We will automatically understand it, recategorize it to understand what exactly is the category, subcategory of problem you're trying to tell us. Then we'll go get the transactions that you may be talking about. You can simply flag those transactions and bingo will go to resolve for it. So literally what you're seeing now is not a need to walk to a branch, not a need to dial up a phone. You can do this on a mobile without any footprint, not requiring to download any application. Okay? and not learning any UX because today what has happened is a lot of focus was on oh how good is my UI it's gone the new world is not about UX the new world is about agents the new language is English right and the new language is voice so in the phase two that you see us launch it's basically you having a conversation with the application and not even typing that right and again we still following your instruction. We're still doing these things. Great experience for a customer. He can do this at 2:00 at night, not wait for the official banking hours. He can do this without learning anything. He can do this without downloading anything. Okay. So, again, that's just an example. And you and and and one will think how well this will be absorbed in a diverse ecosystem like SBI. You'll be amazed. We do more than five and a half lakh hits every day. Five and a half lakh. Can you imagine how much load deflection is happening with just one single page? That is so smart. Right? So that's an example of how India is very boldly stepping in and creating experiences which are unmatched anywhere in the world. And I think that is why again I want to go back to that point. It is not a matter of do we build LLM or not we can catch up to that that's little bit like fuel in your car right I mean it's really what you do with that fuel and I think given the the the the agency that we have that diversity the scale the DPI uh I think we are the learning ground for the world we will export these ideas to the world not the other way around thank you I think now for the audience >> yeah just just to add to your point uh you know how this is going to benefit the end customer right so you know we have lots and lots of examples like for example you know I just mentioned you know uh something like you know how we tried to you know solve the problem of people trying to withdraw cash so in our segment again as you know I have mentioned that you know a customer who is usually who's dealing successfully with us who is transacting banking with us you probably there are so many other products and services which we can probably pitch to him but there's nobody who can physically go and pitch to him right and these are something and that too as Nishant mentioned that you know in their local language and something in a personalized manner so for example we have a beautiful product which is called accidental insurance now uh example that let us say PM See now Kisan you know he works in the field he drives his two-wheeler you know he works on the harvester he works on that you know charawali machine and all that and he's prone to so many accidents you know so many and women who are working day in day out so uh what we do is we prompt them to buy accident insurance and which is coming at a cost of just about 500 rupees for the whole year for a 10 lakhs rupees cover and which is giving OPD IPD benefits also in case of accidents. So imagine you know this kind of products reaching out or coming out back to the customer because we cannot depend finally we cannot depend on our agent only you know to uh bring these c uh you know products to the knowledge of uh the end end user or the customer and similarly students we can prompt them to download the UPI application do digital transactions or use the virtual debit card and stuff. So so many things you know it is ultimately the customer who benefits you know for example we did almost last year we did almost uh 28 lakh uh insurance policies of this accident insurance and all and we collected almost 100 cr of premium but ultimately the amount of claim that we paid was in thousands and you know and number of claims and amount we paid was 125 cr. So imagine the number of families who got benefited from these claims accidents death and the kind of and they were never expecting. So these are the kind of stuff health insurance products mutual fund investments you know for example our finance minister she has mentioned in her budget speech that IPB will act as a catalyst for financial inclusion through the distribution network budget IP that is the kind of importance that we have but I think this the use of this agentic uh AI and you know prompting of uh the uh the or or working as a sales co-pilot or nudging the customer to you know get more and more benefits etc. That is something which uh the the AI can really do well and that is what we have actually started you know journey stages to assisted you know digital assisted banking say I'm look gradually we are moving into the uh AI module and I think the next 3 to 5 years is something which where where we are looking at you know make taking more and more benefits uh to the customers in the rural areas is almost like impossible. So how to reach out to those customers? How to benefit those customers is something which you know we are doing at scale. We are doing at uh you know digitally and we are doing at you know that digital public infrastructure is also the physical being converted into the digital and now gradually it'll become more and more autonomous. So that is what I foresee as the journey and I think this is a good step uh and uh the way we are moving forward and the way we are envisaging and the way we are envisioning uh our journey in the future um you know it's really going to be really wonderful amazing and superb and we'll be setting really a good great example for the entire world. >> Thank you. >> I think we have some minutes remaining for audience engagement. Uh please the gentleman in the first and then over there mics on the way to you. >> Hello. Hi, my name is Swapnil. Swapil digit. I'm the chief product officer of Avanti Finance. It is a financial uh inclusion platform uh co-founded not just invested by Mr. Tata and Mr. Nilkani. Can you >> Mr. Tata and Mr. Nilkani? My question is sir to you the gentleman from uh to the right. Sorry I'm I'm bit fuzzy with all the names here. Um question is sir when the banks are directly reaching out with so much intelligence and technology and everyone having a phone in their pocket directly to the customers uh what is the role of the NBFC sector and how is it going to change one and second are the banks actually open to the idea of directly reaching I mean I'm a CPO of an NBFC and I sometimes joke that if banks did their jobs we wouldn't be needed so what is going on here I mean just a subjective over you would do. >> Oh, very good question. In fact, uh just to give you my example only in our bank, you know, as a payment bank, we are not allowed to lend. Okay, we are not allowed to lend. And we have across the country, we have 26,000 pin codes, right? 26,000 pin codes may say banks who are willing to lend are you know very few and the kind of customer segment which the banks are willing to lend is you know the top end of the customers they are not going to >> Yes. >> Exactly. So like for example for the lending you know we we are working as a referral partner to many of the NBFCs partner banks partnership relationship terminate because we finding so many restrictions and so many issues dealing with them. So now we are tying up with lot of NBFCs because NBFC's they playing a very key role in terms of financial inclusion at the last mile especially in tier three four and six NBFCs micro finance institutions but three four NBFC partners they are willing to open up they are willing to do lot of lending based on flow-based lending or transactional basis lending So these NBFCs are where they are serving as the backbone for us in terms of providing those kind of products where banks find it difficult and they don't they don't reach out and they don't want to risk uh reaching over there. So I think that is one segment where we are playing we are doing a good uh this thing business. >> Can I let me let me add to what probably you're trying to ask. Look uh a traditional bank has a very broad spectrum of play uh both from a risk and a process optimization problem. What NBFCs are very good at is going into that one decisive product and then optimizing risk for that. So which means your arbitration is always better risk. For example, what sir said that you know the traditional bank had so many protocols on how it can be lend and stuff like that. But that's exactly what you arbitrate. You arbitrate risk, right? And NBFC's come in various shape and sizes. So for example, Indian Postal Bank is they are trying to kind of be the poster child of trust. You had a Dhakia who used to come to your home. We all grew up with those spaces and they are now leveraging that trust with your money and therefore bringing people into not just open bank accounts but operating bank accounts and therefore the reach out of government into these direct schemes but NBFC's professionally are lending organizations against zero collateral some collateral unsecurized collateral securized actually we today have Alex please big hand for Alex Bhut finance uh they were one of the pioneers of gold lending even before it was official but look at the amazing scale and how they've done this at part excellence across India right so what I'm trying to say is that NBFC's come in various shape and size but eventually the mode is always going to be your risk segmented for the product of one or two where you will excel over the banks simply because the spread now can this change over next five years well let's just see how well autonomous goes. It's hard to execute some of these strategies, right? The second question, please. >> Yeah. Good afternoon myself Gora Vura. So my question to can you bring the mic closer to you? >> Yeah. Good afternoon everyone. I am started accounta. My question is to Nishan sir and uh I wanted him to expound on how the aoption is going to change MSME credit specifically the credit function in the MSME. If you can share some thoughts on it. Thank you. You know I think uh every bank today is chasing MSME credit. If you understand growth corporate can only arbitrage so much of big projects. So if India has to shine, it is MSME at the core of how they do it. And as we bring more GST, MSME for the first time is far more formalized than it was let's say four years ago. So today for example, a GST reference is a basic of an MSME. Right now you have amazing workflows that arbitrate on Insta loan based on your GST returns and how much can we do. Unfortunately for us, the small enterprises may not still represent its entire business on an uh MSME portal yet because they go in for the sector logs or a bunch fees kind of a provision in the GST. If you ever visit a stall there, there is a there is a very interesting demo where any of the NBFC people who's carrying a mobile app can simply take a photograph of a shop and what that'll do is it'll suddenly build up the inventory of that shop from that photograph. Okay? And it'll give you an accosted value of the inventory he holds. So suddenly now microl lending on that as a collateral is less risk than uh you know just a simple blank entry on the GST. So I think there are many many interesting stories around that we are working with many banks to crack into that. uh but absolutely that is one of the biggest problems AI is going to solve for in India and if we really want a shining India that will grow and will become the number two eventually in the world then MSME is what we have to solve for and AI is paying an incredible value everything from a CPV verification to the actual cross-section of ownership of the shop to all of that is that brilliant you know DPI that he was talking about and the more of these services as they come along these are not untrustworthy records they are trustworthy records therefore therefore the entire speculation and how you kind of innovate on this >> if I were to simply add to what Nishant mentioned u see what what's happening right now we are moving from a world which was very I would say digitized in a very insignificant manner to highly digitized right so the number of data points that are available to banks and NBFCs to loan to lend out and increasing because I remember about eight years ago I met this small NBFC out of Bangalore and at that time the alternate data that they were collecting on their own was a big thing and they had they were literally like Ishan mentioned going out to those small MSMES taking pictures and even small uh micro sort of uh enterprises going to their places figuring out whether they had TV or fridge to kind of get their creditworthiness etc. But that's moving further. It's getting increasingly automated in terms of data collection. So as we move towards more and more automated data collection, the ability to for the MSMES to get the credit right at that time when they are like in the process of transacting will significantly increase. But like Nishan mentioned, there will still be some places where the data isn't there or would not come up. Uh that's that those are the only places with NBFCs and others who are more innovative with these approaches we'll have to solve for. We are increasingly moving in that direction. Oaken is of course one and even you ULI which is more yeah in in that direction. Okay chairman over there. >> Yeah very good evening uh to all of the panelist and delegates. >> Uh yeah so uh my question is to Goshan sir. I have seen uh Indian payment uh sorry postal bank being built up on the basis of trust since the beginning. Uh so now when uh artificial intelligence is being uh brought into picture how can we shift that trust from from uh humans to uh autonomous infrastructure autonomous banking when we have no we don't yet have uh certifications for uh a IML based applications and uh uh there is no proper benchmarking. So um yes of course the trust is there you know the trust is there but yes as more and more digitization is happening autonomous processes etc are getting developed and they are going to come into play but the fact or something behind uh the mind of the customer is always going to be there that you know in case something happens or in case I get stuck somewhere in case my money gets stuck somewhere my transaction gets stuck stuck somewhere there is always a grammar se or a postman behind. I can contact him because prominent influenc even if I am delving into digital or I am getting more and more autonomous in my transactions but in case something goes bad or in case I get stuck somewhere uh the gramind is there and that is one reason why the usage has really accelerated nowadays. You know people are more and more getting into this and for examp that kind of you know trust factor always plays. >> So uh more more on uh safety uh the risk resil resiliency for >> let me add to that I think your question was how will AI help in reinforcing trust is that your question >> I mean how the uneducated people be able to trust on the autonomous banking. Yeah, let me explain that. Look, uh I think the very basic architecture that you saw that we either showed you for cognitive and all has a very strong play on trust and trust is not built on one layer. It's a multi-layer architecture where you build trust. So everybody understands guard rails, okay? And that's one way to enforce uh trust. But then you also have agents which are guardian angels that supervise all of this autonomous story to then kind of really pick up stuff that they feel is deflecting trust down to the point of your choice of model. So let me make it real for you. So let's take two of the largest LLM provider. You take a open AI and you look at claude. Okay. Claude in its fabric builds trust and ethics which means if it gets into a situation that is unknown to it which you will in autonomous cases it will use it ethics to engage versus open AI is more directed in nature which means if it gets into this ambiguous story it'll do what the supervision model says by default. Okay so those are the levels of trust. Now I can go into lots of technicality but bottom line I'm trying to say is trust is something which is very very important. Add to trust is being enforced by RBI. Let's take India as an example which means at some point time if today fraud happened there was an individual being hanged in the new world how will you hang a agent? That means agents have to be more auditable and neutral and not biased. For example, when you look at art tech stack, one of the first things we invented three years ago was a thought engine. So thought engine is actually a complete journal of how every LLM is taking a decision. So it kind of says this is the data I got, this is what I think it is, this is what I'm doing and this is the outcome. Right? So literally everything is far more documented in this new world uh with this thought engine kind of technology that we bring to you than it was in the old world. So again uh the layer of trust is multi-zoned multi-layered and uh absolutely trust becomes the foundation of any stack today tomorrow forever because that's what banks are >> and just to add to RBI person couldn't be here on this panel today I think he got he got sick uh but there was another person from RBI speaking in a different panel yesterday and I was hearing him and he he mentioned very clearly that RBI is going to subject all the agents and all the tech that banks are building to the same level of scrutiny and test as they are doing with the human right. So there's no way you can simply get away by saying that hey AI did it and it's we don't know how AI does it. So that's the level of testing and qualification and certification and regulation that RBI is going to put >> and in fact just to build on that point um 6 months ago we did a round table in GFF on autonomous banking which was a representation of standards for autonomous to RBI. So if you ever want to have a paper of how banks are thinking about trust today, you can actually go to our site or go to our stall and pick up that autonomous banking uh uh representation that we're doing to RBI. So again, it's a typical regulator problem. Uh can you regulate something that does not exist? You can only participate in a standard setting and then kind of you know come back with regulation really faster and good ways and bad ways both ways. And RBI is a immense learning. I mean I can just give example of Indian Postal Bank. We were having a discussion. You know they were the first ones to really come up with a cyber insurance with every account they were publishing because their people were so vulnerable and when RBI audited and saw this great thing they had done they went and made it a default. Right. So again so so it's not like RBI can dream of better standards. I think it's a industry collative where we kind of create guidance paper. We kind of try to solve for it. Take RBI's view and then we kind of it's a it's a it's a circle that'll keep on. Sometimes the industry will be ahead, sometimes the regulator will be ahead. So I think that'll happen but trust is >> I think AI will also have to be trained especially in the banking segment to have its limits defined. you know where the buck stops ultimately where he feels or AI feels or AI engine or agent feels that he cannot further answer any further questions uh he has to just refer it to a call center or somebody or a human. So I mean ultimately you know there are only certain roles and rules which will be defined for the AI as well and that is what I think uh the the banking sector especially uh has to work on uh because we cannot unlimitedly you know keep on engaging into something which we cannot protect. So with that confidence in place that that even though AI and autonomous is is changing the way we going to be doing banking and finance I think we can leave this room assured that uh we are not going to be completely taken for granted by AI or not taken on a wild ride. I would like to thank all of you for being here and thank the my fellow panel members. So thank you so much. I think this is the close of the session. Thank you. are. Heat. Heat. Uh good evening everyone. Uh I am Raji and I'm just here to quickly introduce our panel for the evening. Uh I I just start by making a small joke so that I don't feel awkward for not using the podium because podiums are not very friendly for short people. Um yes so I would love to invite uh Shri Nagarajan GIS who is the current principal commissioner of Surat and he is also the ex director of technical education in Gujarat. We also have uh Sukit Amin the founder of Sunboard Innovations. Um we also have uh Padmishri ma'am who is the executive vice president and MD at Capgeemini. We also have Sarika ma'am here uh who is the group's chief corporate responsibility officer and member of the group executive committee Capgeemini group. Along with that uh we will also shortly be uh joined by the by sir uh Mahib and we will also have a quick quick introduction uh of him. So uh over to you Padmashi ma'am. Thank you very much. It's my pleasure to be sitting in front of all of you. Am I audible? Yeah, not at all. Okay, some of somewhat. Okay, I think that is the acoustics here. So we uh currently have a startup founder here, social startup founder. We have a government uh uh is officer right sitting here and then a CSR head for a large organization sitting right here as you all can see. So there's a lot that is happening here and I think together they can create wonders out of the whole thing. So but before starting all these things I just wanted to set the context for this right AI is the is where we are all sitting in here the capabilities AI capabilities have skyrocketed all of you would have seen what you know the latest version of Opus is doing or everything and might have also gone into a little bit of a depression I'm sure like how I did a little while back last couple of weeks but having said that AI can create humongous impact across every sector that we can think about and especially in the social sector. So what we are trying to what we'll be trying to do today is uh to capture there you go the fourth person has come who is also from the government from the UP government and he's a very powerful innovation hub CEO for the UP government welcome on board yeah so so you you you really have the power here right so we are going to try and ask questions which can help bring uh a lot of insights from all of them but just as I said I was talking about the foundational things AI is there but there's There's a lot of data that systematically the government of India has tried to create as well. You all I don't need to repeat everything but even today when you're walking in digi I didn't even think that digiatra can be worked to be able to do a facial recognition to walk in. So the kind of data that our government has created to enable each of our the population scale implementation is not funny. be it UPI up this thing the government has also gone into the investment side of the game so the AI innovation hub and etc government has set aside 11 cr I wish it is more as well but we'll talk about it but then 11 cr 11,000 cr is not a small sum to be talking about so everything is going well what more can we do to impact the social sector through AI and we'll get some of the answers and many of you I'm presuming will be founders startup owners here and let's get all the answers from here. Yeah. Is that fine? Should we start? So, let's go. The first first thing is I really wanted to get the flavor from each one of you on how what is that one thing that you all think can have biggest impact in the social sector as AI, right? the biggest impact that AI can do to the social sector and build build it on that on top of it and then we can pick it up and talk about how can each one of them carry something back right and how to how can they go back and implement it as well. So biggest biggest impact on social sector any one of you can pick it up and then we'll move from there. >> So uh this is a very interesting session here and uh before I start I just want to have a raise of hands. How many of you are startup founders now are going to do your startups? So I think majority are startups and uh I think it's a great thing to have because normally startup and impact don't go in the same sentence but it is on us we all people to change the narrative and we are going to uh do it using technology and none other than AI is going to support us in this journey. I believe that all technology is meant for the people. Okay. So if you are building something and if it is not meant for people there is no use of building it. Technology doesn't have any value unless it makes a difference. I'm very much clear on that. So I congratulate each and every one of you who have taken up time to come here and think about how do I use technology to achieve my mission and goal. And whether you are from government, whether you are from NGO sector, whether you are a startup founder, if you have the ultimate thing in mind, you are doing the best job. You know Gandhi G said that whenever you are in doubt, you recall the common man, the the most poorest man that you would have you would have seen and think about it. Whatever action you are going to take, will it make any small positive difference in his life? then your action is right. So that is a test of the impact. When it comes to what is a problem that is worth solving is the biggest challenge that we face in every social activity whether it is from the government or from the civil society is changing mental models and behaviors of the people. How do we do it? And technology can help us. Changing mental models in nutrition, changing mental models in education, changing mental models in cleanliness, changing mental models in civic sense. All this is going to be very challenging. We all know that changing someone's point of view is the most challenging task in this world. Everything else is very easy because we are working with the people and how do we take use AI to impact for that. And some of the most impactful areas from my experience which I have seen is now we are getting highly urbanized country more than 50% of our population is going to urban areas. So urban governance is a very important challenge that is to be it needs to be solved at the earliest. By arman I don't mean New Delhi municipal corporation. I am coming from Surat somewhat Surat can also be counted but there are 157 Nagar palikas you know municipal nagar palikas in Gujarat itself. So there will be thousands of nagar palikas they are all having challenges in funds manpower and all that. So how do we support them? Second is foundational literacy K12 what is that inbuilt advantage that we can give to our kids in school so that they can face the future we are all the transition generation some we are doing certification course and this and that to manage this entire transition we have a different challenge but the natives there was digital natives now a native education also needs to be done so these are very impact third is nutrition for women how do we do something use AI to challenge so from my perspective these three are highly big scale population scale problems that are worth solving and it is not any one person's uh absolutely >> thing and when we talk about startup we talk about unicorn >> yes >> I wish that you all build impact unicorn which will make a difference in the life of 1 billion people not $1 billion valuation >> absolutely that is the social thing right so all of education nutrition the third one what did you say sir education >> urban urban >> urban urban governance right these are these are really hot things right now and the Indian government is going ahead and investing quite a bit on that. So we'll learn more over to you Sarika. >> So plus one to all that you said but from where I see if I have to look at it from a corporate standpoint I would say access at scale is the one thing since you asked for one thing Padma you know of course all the ones that you said need that support as well. Uh the reason I say access at scale is because we are a country we know we are large we are diverse we speak multiple languages the digital fluency of people is different the you know the gadgets we use are different so really when we have to look at AI it should be something that helps bridge those access problems uh today you know we have a lot of people who are skilled there are most corporates do skilling training programs right but there is still a gap between what they are skilled and how the employment is generated. We have people who are eligible for lots of government programs but they are not reached. We have people who you know are informed so they understand some of the policies that they can use but they don't know how to use them. So really how do we create an ecosystem through AI where AI is that bridge layer you know between opportunities between supply demand gap and between you know bridging that gap between the halves and the have nots. So you know I I was at another session just now and there was this person who asked us to imagine. They said just imagine if you could you know one of the farmer the farmers could just point to the crop and know when exactly it is right time to harvest it which is the nearest place that they can sell it. You know that's what AI can do for you. Uh what if there was a student who could just learn in their native language? Why do we have to always learn in English right? And just imagine if you know we we have so many large you know events and programs where we you know have food wastage is one of the biggest challenges for India. It's not that we don't produce enough it's just that we don't know how to preserve that and you know this that only you know 30% of the food reaches the plate actually the rest is all wastage. So how do you make sure that that reaches the right people in the in the most appropriate form. So access at scale in my view is something which is very relevant for India. >> Fantastic. Just to summarize so far right. So he talked about the sectors which is education, health and urban governance and and how do you get access to the people at large. That's a sc that's a that's a problem that is yet to be solved at a population scale yet. I think agriculture I know quite a bit but there are other sectors also where we could education also a lot happening but we'll we'll ask more questions there. Yeah over to you. >> Okay. >> So my background is uh we are working for blind and visually impaired. So disability sector is the key area that we are focusing and what we've seen that after AI that has come in I'm talking from 2022 the entire situation has changed for people with disabilities. So AI has created a level playing field for uh people with disabilities not just for blindness even if you are hearing impaired or dyslexic every single space AI has come in to help you in education independent living. So that is a very big change that has come where people are more confident in doing things and that has reduced their dependency on others. So that's where in future that will enable people to have as normal life as possible uh that we can have. So that is where the AI will take them. >> That is beautifully said. Thank you very much. Over to you Mah. If I can build on what he said, you know, we just reading a report yesterday actually and it said that the adoption of AI by people who are neurodeiverse or who are uh you know have some kind of a uh their their adoption is 55% whereas the average for all of us is about 39%. And and these are numbers that clearly show how that gap can be bridged. >> Absolutely. >> Absolutely. Absolutely right. Mah over to you. >> Thank you. Thank you Padma. And uh first of all uh congratulations to entire CSR box for this nice initiative. So since uh I come from the innovation background and uh I come from the innovation hub itself and which is which works on a hub and spoke model. So we have around 80 incubation centers across the UB with 2,700 startups and innovation hub is uh established at Dr. APA galam technical university which is one of the largest affiliating university of India. So uh from my point of view the AI amalgamation into the education as sir said uh that's the most important thing and which is going to be most impactful also because we have initiated few things. I'm not going to say that what should be done but what the good practices we are opting over there using AI is we are uh checking the copies using AI although we are not fully dependent on that but yes for the support of evaluators we are using AI means few cases are there in the university what happens that evaluation is not that much proper the deserving candidate doesn't get the right marks right. So we are using AI to assist the evaluator that whatever the marks has been given is right or wrong that will assist although there is a bypass option option also that is the first thing which we are doing and we are also making AI university means each and every uh course would be having the AI integration into that. So we are working model for that also that is second thing. Third thing what I think since UP is being represented with one lakh of villages and there are lot of farmers so AI in the area of agriculture that play very important role because we have lot of startups here also we are representing in hall number six six with 6.3 and 6.4 4 install number and with 44 startups. Uh so a couple of startups are there in the area of AI. What exactly they are doing? They are predicting that that in this particular season which crop could be feasible for the farmers right so I I believe these areas are most important area where AI can play very important role. So thank you so much. >> Thank you very much Mahib. Now let's start looking diving deeper. Right. So you got a generic answer from all of them as to sector and where you have to focus on maybe this time I'll start with you Nagaraj. Yeah. So I many of you are sitting here are from you know founders of startup etc and maybe looking to partner with the government in a big way. Um what are the ways uh partnerships that can be established with the government? Um is there a jugard sir to be able to do this? We discussed this right a little away from uh you know just a little while back but how do they get to partner with the government or government how do you select can you just throw some light on that for all of them please? Yeah. So today we are talking about uh you know impactdriven startups. So government is the best partner because government has scale. In fact I always used to say I've been working with the startup ecosystem for more than a decade now. People always say I don't know I want to do a startup. I don't know what to do. I said just look at government. We are the biggest problem statement holder in the country. pass. So you can bring all your solutions because whatever we do there are 100 problems that are still unsolved. So we should start with a problem that is you know uh which is uh very very imminent. And here I would like to give one tips is that the value of innovation lies in its context. Whatever you do, whatever technology you may have, unless it is applied to a context or a situation, it doesn't have any value or it has an alternative value. I'll tell you one example like say titanium. Titanium was you know stronger than steel, lighter than aluminium, very much suitable for aviation and this for last 50 60 years entire aviation industry billions of dollars of value creation done. Somebody thought that I could use this material to make a blade runner's you know foot. So it is a very cross application. Velcro was designed for one purpose and now everyone is using velcros. Internet is a big example. It started as a defense project. Now it is changing the world and a is again you know riding on the wave of what internet could do. So whenever you are talking about technology it is not about the advanced technology but real technology. So if you want to get any government work or order or whatever first is that your solution should be uh fit to the problem. So and technology should be appropriate to the location. Most of the time we all will work in places which are like having access divide as uh she has mentioned or you know knowledge divide or even resource divide rural urban divide. There are so many divides. So how do we cross that? So using the right technology for the situation is the first thing. So having a fit solution is the first requirement. Second is establishing your credibility. You always need an inside champion in the government who is also a believer in your idea. >> Yeah. >> So first is that you should find the believer where you who already thinks that this is a problem worth solving and I need someone who can you know jump the hoops for this problem who can do the running on in in that. So you find that kind of a person because most of the time startups work in a spaces which are problem unressed so far. So you are in a clean slate situation. So you can co-build that solution with the whatever government or agency or partner. Suppose you have a product which is already mature and it is doing well in the market. So now then you have to do go according to the uh purchase uh uh policies. So you have to study those policies and most of the governments are now giving for the first few orders at least first few lakhs it is easier to get um um you know first order and gem portal is a very important thing most of the time if you ask submit a project they'll say are you on gem portal so if gem portal is government e procurement uh marketplace so it is very easy you can just sign up it is just like Shopify it is a government Shopify you can say so you can just sign up there and there are a lot of gem consultants who help but it's not required and then your product most of the time it will be innovative product or different product there will be no equivalence so you have to apply to get product category creation so if you are a category creator you you need not be uh Steve Jobs to be a category creator you know at least you can do a gem category creation with your product because you will you solve a problem that is you know un addressed so far. Third is that everything in social sector impact sector works on relationships. The more you go and talk to people, your passion source, you generate a set of believers who believe in your idea, they will bet not on your project, not on your uh solution, but on your character and your you know personality that you have projected, the assurance, the trust you have built. That is what will break the ice and and have a lot of patience. But if you have patience the day you crack then there is no stopping entry barriers entry easy. So you need to play the long game and relationship based uh you know approach always works because people first trust you then they trust your project. So I think these are absolutely practical solutions. >> Very very valid ones. uh right Nagraj gem portal and then contextual real problems that you're trying to solve but once that is there I'm going to go to mahib now I'll tell you the order once that is there so all these ideas are great you know contextual etc mahib but you are running the innovation hub explain help us help the team all of us understand how do you scale really from there how do you not get stuck at that ideation and in the lab how do How do you move from the lab to the reality? Is there a is there a is there a framework or anything for that that people can have in mind? >> So starting a startup is not a rocket science. It's very simple. Uh before starting uh your startup your journey identify that the problem you are going to solve should be the real problem. That's the basic thing. problem. So, so if real and we are privileged that we are in India because it's developing country and every moment every on every step there is a problem and I mean based on every problem there is a potential solution also to startup you should have that side to see actual problem and actual solution. So what happens since we are the member of the evaluation committee. So in in some of the cases we get the startups coming to solve without any problem statement. Right? So identification of a right problem is the initiation of anything. You can scale up only if you are working with the right problem. Then your question government partner then government become automatically your partner. So most of you are the startup sitting here and I believe that you must have got the grant either from the department of science and technology or from the MSME DBT UP. So government is by default partner of the startup. So every everywhere and what we are doing we are at every week we are organizing a meeting with our startup with the government officers. startup B2G business so so that's the way we we are doing right >> thank you that is good from an engineering perspective you are running it right uh okay if you can help understand how do people scale right so you have identified the well- definfined problem statement physically handicapped how could you help them in this how do you go about and scale from an engineering ing perspective from every other angle if you can throw some light it'll be great. >> So uh the sector that we deal uh they're not so much on social media. So what we uh what we work is first of all what we did is we created detailed business plan. So business plan does contain what's our set problem solution how we are going to market who we will be talking to what will be your strategy what will be your price everything needs to be very much clear before even you actually build the product because once you build the product then it's very difficult to go back and refine the product on a continuous cycle. So what we what approach we do is always we identify what the customer is. We do a customer profiling and then we target that and we see where all that person goes. So for us it was pretty much easier because a lot of people we whom we target are youth who are age of 18 to 35 who are preparing for competitive exams who are part of an NGO or in college or school. So we know where all to go and where all we need to spread awareness about our product. Provide demonstration work with a community uh and identify people who are influencing that community who can talk about your product who can provide demonstration provide reviews to the uh groups that they are in. And that's how reference would work. But every industry is different. So every industry needs a very specific approach that you take and that comes with trial, test, fail and then you have to stand up again with a new uh process. So it's all about process. There's no straightforward answer that anybody can give. Once you start working, you start getting results and you start uh molding your uh approach. >> Yeah. Thank you, Sukit. Now I'll move to Sarika. AI is uh very uh what do I say it can be used for any purpose right so legal purposes as well if I could take it in that direction and all of the social sector is working in many of the things in the vulnerable communities etc right how do you ensure that there is the bias is taken care that you do not harm in the process of use of AI um you you you kind of safeguard the vulnerable communities within Sarika from a large organization that you are coming in we are coming in from so help us understand how do you take care of all these things >> so I think the first thing we should accept is that AI is not neutral so you know like your previous technological uh revolutions let's say mobility cloud or uh automation which were in a sense neutral from a technology standpoint AI is not neutral It is really reflecting it's like a child you know what you teach a child and you know most of us have kids at least I do and you know it's uh when you when you uh when you tell teach the child uh repeatedly reinforcing things that's what it learns and AI is just like that so it really depends on what it is taught what are the data sets it's fed who what are the assumptions that their makers are making you know like who their designers are making and hence when people say that oh you know the AI is not uh is not good for the vulnerable communities. Actually, it is not AI that is not good for the vulnerable communities. It's because these vulnerable communities have always been away from access. They have been under represented. They have not been included. They are far away from design. Which is why when AI reflects what it sees in the society, then it amplifies that gap. So you know the chances of it really widening the gap instead of bridging it can be quite stark. Uh I think there are couple of ways in which you could make sure that by you know we this kind of a gap is not widened and we use AI to bridge you know the technological and the digital divide. First of course which all of us know is make sure that there is inclusion by design. And what do we mean by inclusion by design? you know you were talking about how you run the processes. If the if the whole uh program is designed for people with very high English fluency or let's say for you know very high uh digital literacy so you know act knowing how to use uh digital u u uh products or then you know with a very high um let's say bandwidth requirements then by design you are excluding those set of people who should be included actually. So when you design itself you need to make sure that you're taking care of all the various type of you know uh users that exist. The second of course is you know higher trans uh transparency and here when we say transparency we should let people know that there is AI in the loop. there is AI which is influencing decision like I know there are lots of nowadays level one interviews where it's actually an AI that is evaluating the responses but the you know interviewe is not aware and obviously you know that agent that is doing the interview is biased because of the way you know the data sets have been fit. So m making sure that there is transparency in when there is um AI in the loop has to be called out and I strongly believe that you know you should be able to challenge that as well you know challenge those proh those processes the processes you can't challenge are not trustable and the last thing I would say is that you know governance is an ongoing thing it's not like you again said it's not something you create one day and you forget about it you don't tell your child one day that oh you need to you know make sure that you stay clean, you reinforce it every single time. So same way we need to make sure that we are putting these checks and balances the governances every single time because biases can creep in, you know, data changes, you know, context changes. So making sure that you know you're constantly watching these and navigating to make sure that the least represented are the first ones and not an afterthought in the design. >> Very well said. Very well said. So inclusive AI it is right. So in fact if you look at the global picture India is the one which has actually walked the path sincerely in the world in the in the path of inclusive AI. What do I mean by inclusive AI? We are making AI available through Bhashini to everybody to the last mile of an agriculturist to the person in the school in a government school that is inclusive AI. If this is inclusive AI back to you all now this is the last round I'll ask questions to all of you and if India should be the leader in being the inclusive global leader in inclusive AI what are the top three non-negotiables if you will right maybe I can start from you Mahib and then come this way if that's fine with you >> so is it compulsory to tell about the three things >> anything you can say one two three >> all right I think one or two would be sufficient Yes. Yes. Of course. >> In that case. So, so AI inclusion in every part of our life is going to happen very soon. So, applying a small sensor in the urinal and based on that sensor uh small screen is there in front and while in the process of urinal it is about to tell how many I mean six different parameters that what disease are inside your body so based on these things he is doing couple of things one thing he's telling the data of that particular area that is area that is number one number two he's sgesting a doctor also so I mean what I want to say is if AI is has entered in your urinal also then of course it is going to be the integral part of your entire life very soon. Now the biggest challenge while uh making it the integral part of your life is the infrastructure of AI government of UP because I'm representing we are confined to the UP itself. So we know the fact uh AI infrastructure is very costly affair. I mean hiring the server or making our own server is actually tough. So AI infrastructure one thing then server cost is second thing. Although now there are few companies which has made a good competition between all the I mean among all the service providers of the AI server but since we have 14 mega paflop server so we know the cost of infrastructure and out of 700 more than 770 institution which we have surprisingly we have just six institutions are there who are having the AI server suppose up imagine So I believe these two things are important and non-negotiable. >> Thank you. Thank you. Over to you. >> Um according to me I think first of all we should consider AI as a friend and not a threat. >> Very nice. uh because not today today we may not be using extensively within our organizations especially MSMES but uh startups or MSMES will have to adopt if they have to grow and they have to be sustainable and like sir said yes the infrastructure cost can be high AI services can be expensive at times uh but if you look at it in the bigger picture it your mental piece your wellness that everybody talks about and if you just leave it to an system to do that for you your mental wellness your free time and which you can use it for more productive things. So I think you should embrace AI and accept how it comes and evolve with AI rather than be stagnant with your old systems and processes. >> Thank you. Thank you. Over to you Nagra. >> Yeah. >> Non-negotiables. >> Yeah. non-negotiables is that we should keep one thing in mind is that AU is like Kajuk Kishm. It is not the K. So don't mistake Kajuku Kishm for the K. First build the K >> and second is consent. Whenever we are using any data the consent should be there. So the user should be informed. So if there is you feel any fundamental or human right will be slightly even touched better you think twice on it. And third is AI is enabler not a replacement. And uh if you can't avoid AI, if you can avoid AI, please avoid it because right fit to the solution is more important than AI. >> Very well said. >> So it's not like not against whether it is fitting to your situation, your requirement. If the functionality fit is there, we should of course do it. But otherwise we should avoid it. >> Very well said. The kajuk kishmas you said only where it is needed and when it is needed. Thank you very much. Over to you. >> So you know when when you said three I thought of three but some of them were not the ones that they had said and now I want to add those as well you know. So mine will be little more than three but in summary I think uh one uh of course you know access because in my mind India is not represented here. This is not all of India. you know we not the people sitting here don't are not the right representatives so there is a lot more diversity there are a lot more people who need the access through AI and as the bridge layer so for me access will remain number one for for a country like India second would be of course trust and you alluded to that you know you if you're using anything which is not you know uh is a violation which goes against what is the right thing to do it's a no no and third in my mind is also the fact that uh Not all of us need to suddenly become AI engineers. All of us don't need to start coding and you know uh have a FOMO that hey I you know I don't understand how those LLMs work. You know I think we need to train India needs to scale and train the people who will be using it. The frontline workers who will use AI for you know triangulating data uh you know the kirana stores the farmers how will they use it? How how the students would use it? So we'll need to train them uh to be able to use AI as much as you know we spend thought on how to create one. Very well said. Right. So first of all inclusive AI is is what we need to walk the path with. Ensure that we are doing only the things where it is needed. Don't put AI just because you have a hammer. Don't go and hammer everything else under the sun. Right? So keep it to what it is required to be doing and im remember that it is a fantastic school stu fantastic tool and leverage it where it is needed. Right? So thank you so much. I think we are on top of the hour right now and uh it was a pleasure talking to each one of you here and uh thanks for the lovely audience. If you have any questions you could always come and speak to us outside and thanks to the CSR box which partnered with us to be make this making this happen. Thank you very much. >> Thank you. Good luck to all in your ventures. >> So we can we can take few questions if you have. >> Sorry. Uh so my question is uh uh when when we started the conversation you said impact and startups don't come together but it's very good that they are coming together. Uh my question is so why do impact and startups why do they really need to come together and why not nonprofits and impact and why does the government support the nonprofits more than the startups that it is doing right now because if you talk about social impact the heart of the nonprofits is far more you know in the in the impact space. So why does it always have to be uh driven by sustainable finance uh and why can't it be just impact see these are uh various definitions that we you know define to run the systems but fundamentally whatever your name is whether you are an NGO whether you are a startup whether you don't have a startup first is entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship means trying to solve a problem and if you solve a problem that is marketable then it becomes a product and it goes to the market and if that market is highly scalable then it becomes a startup. So the core is solving a problem with an entrepreneurial mindset. If you are ready to solve a problem with an entrepreneur mindset, whether you put a foundation, whether you put a trust, whether you put a DPIT recognized startup, it doesn't matter. It is only the type of balance sheet that you want to keep. Ultimately the thing is what is the problem that you want to solve. If you have that solving mindset, problem solving mindset and you want to take up something which generally other people are not doing, then you are an entrepreneur. So impact means solving a problem and what framework you want to do then that market and sustainability should be there. I think someone in the back someone was here sir it was a it was a nice talk sir uh the the problem I want to bring out is most uh anyone can answer sir. So the problem is uh most of the founders or the people like us don't even know the problem that we are going to solve doesn't require a 100 billion parameter LLM to solve it. Every day a new model is launched and we get confused that this one is better than that. So I believe the next era will not be of LLM. It will be ruled by SLMs. So we need to think that whatever problem we are solving is a very little problem which doesn't require such a high compute power or a high uh parameter model. So accordingly we need to develop an ecosystem which helps us to build our uh presently that ecosystem is missing. If I want to build up a small uh problem solving app for example, so I I will suddenly jump to OpenAI or some highest uh parameter model and solve a small problem while what I require is a small model uh specifically built or what should I call it a application specific intelligent agent that is what we need. So that ecosystem we need to build around and uh provide it to the founders future founders I think. So you are saying that that ecosystem is needed. >> Yes. >> Okay. >> Yeah. You want to answer? >> I just Yeah. Uh I just want to say as a founder right as a tech founder we we use a lot of platforms for you know uh coding and every platform has their own uniqueness and uh every u tech person who is using the platform has different style of engaging. So it varies from person to person on how they are interacting with the platform. That is one thing I would say and every day like you said there are so many platforms that they are coming in. Now you it's a personal thing that has to go is research and you have to keep yourself updated on what is the differentiator between each platform because every model gives you a detailed description of what improvements or enhancement has come. So that analysis should happen and as my CTO every day he spends two hours just analyzing what are the new things that have come up in an AI space whether it's a platform it's a product or any other thing that's directly indirectly related to our business. So that time you need to spend on research rather than uh doing coding. So that that's that has to be from the founders's side. >> Uh very uh A very important question for the CSR uh side right I'm Sard I'm the director of know your careers right and we are working for the innovation schools and with the help of AI and innovation infrastructure so like what CSR is planning to build in the schools and to deploy uh something for the school students especially for the class 8 to 12 students who are seeking uh some guidance and fund supports also from the government and the other bodies also to build their own startup or innovation ideas for the CSRs uh for ma'am especially for you >> innovation in the schools >> innovation in schools >> innovation in schools so you know a couple of things so first and foremost government is doing a lot of work in making sure that the skills of the future and the programs of skills of the future the mic also gave away so are kind of a guiding like a lighthouse about what skills will be required for tomorrow because there's no point in skilling students in areas which will be redundant tomorrow right so one is the government is running a lot of programs corporates on the other hand are also uh and I can speak for corporates large corporates you know what we do is we assess the needs that we are seeing our own hiring needs what are the kind of skills that we are looking you know to hire and those are the ones that we dovetail back into the programs of course at the school level you know it's not you know Java uh coding and all but it is of course it finds its way through you know the programs into the school programs also so lots of innovation required at school one of the things I would however you know call out is that um a lot of the and things are changing in India you know there's a lot of teaching by road or you know but things like AI and all need to be learned by experiencing by touching feeling and I know there are lots of organizations including the government that supports things like tinkering labs, robotic labs and I know for sure Anurag is here he's our India head for capemini you know one of the proudest moments we've had is one of the schools which we support they they actually contested in a open robotics uh competition where children of all schools participate and they came third on merit so for us you know that's the kind of pride so I think it's a combination of what skills how do we equip them through you know uh programs, training and also tie it with employability because at the end of the day nobody wants to be skilled without employment. >> Thanks. >> I just wanted to add one point to what you said. If you are a founder with for profit and if you're looking for CSR then that doesn't happen. You have to ask cool to reach out to the CSR. So that's the approach. Secondly, if you are a founder seeking CSR for product development, then it's a different approach that incubators uh they can provide and I have been one of the beneficiary through the CAPGI grant for product development. So, incubators are one of the uh organizations that can help you connect with the corporates who have grants for product development. >> Thanks a lot. Thanks. Yeah, I think uh I'll request everyone to be here even the panel to be here. I int I would like to have Anurak sir to felicitate the panel members here. Can we have a huge round of applause for the panel that we had here? Thank you so much Anurakar and thank you so much for the panel. We will we'll have a group photo for the audience. We are not yet done. We are uh going to continue uh for next half an hour. Uh we have something very interesting coming up with LEGO. Uh so hoping to have you here. Hi. Hi. >> It's Hi all, good evening. Uh we will be having Lego education product demo launch for the computer uh science and literacy. So please be seated because this is going to be a very interactive session by Mr. Atish Gonalves who heads the LEO education. Thank you. Can we can we turn I've turned on this thing. The audio audio is through HDMI HDMI or through the Where is the audio coming from? The HDMI or a separate cable? >> HDMI separately. >> Yep. Okay, that comes here. Okay, now let's do a test. Can we do a quick test if people are here? But I would like to Okay, cool. We don't want that there. Not showing. Tell them to not have that. That's it. Our brains don't turn into mush because of it. Write that down. It's really important to use AI responsibly. Not everybody. >> Can we not show the the screen there? >> Actually, it's because of your laptop only. >> Is there a setting? >> Yeah. No, no. Okay, no, no, no. One second. I think it's in the show during the presenter view. I don't want to show the settings. No, it's not that. I think he has to turn off on the screen. Custom show. You need to do it from here. Show just No, it is a Mac. No, no, it's a Mac. It's different. I think we need to It's still showing the >> Just let it be. >> No, no. I don't want it to show. Okay. Use presenter view. >> Maybe click on it. >> Swap displays. Okay. >> No, no, no, no. >> Okay. Yeah, it was. And then Yeah, this is okay. It's okay now. No, it's a bit wide screen, but I think it's okay. Do we need a click clicker? >> We don't have >> clicker. Okay, then I have to stand here and Okay, this is working. >> Okay, this is good. Actually, I can see my notes as well. >> Uh, and then I want the audio is working and then so what I will do is I will do a test. What time do you want me to start? >> You can just do we'll start the phone. You can just do the Yeah. So this is where let's see we can either do this or I can try let's see this is where if I go back does it does it go okay yeah it's okay fine so then I can go from here >> when you will be connecting to >> I think I should try I should try to connect otherwise I think we're set up otherwise Okay. Okay. This is not actually maybe there's an option in my settings. I know what I should have done actually. >> I can see an error. >> No, actually what I want to do was Okay, it's coming. >> It's coming. Yeah. Okay. So, here what we can do >> is we can change the displays actually to do mirror. I think then this >> mirror is better. Okay. >> Maybe it's better. >> Uh you think that's better or just better like previously actually? No. Let's do for No, let's do stop mirroring. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> You want to try it? >> Yeah. I think what I'll do is I'll do the extended. This is so the this one I I'll do as the extended display display >> location. >> Yeah. >> Yes. >> Okay. So I'll have to make it work. It's okay. I'll connect it now. Let me just connect it now already. It's fine. It's fine. also ready I think. So it just means that I can I mean let's see with the camera if it's working or not. Is it working or what? >> Oh, no. Not hit play. >> Yeah, that is working. >> It's working now. >> Yeah, I can track you, right? >> Yeah, it's working. It's working. It's working. The problem is it would be nice if I could see it on the screen, but it's okay. Let me just open the project file again. When do you want me to start? Now or >> you can start. >> Okay. >> Maybe you can start with the interactive session and everything. >> Okay. >> Do I need this mic or these work? Okay. >> Amazing. Okay, how is everyone doing? You still have the energy at the end of the day. Sorry, we were having some technical issues setting up. You can also come forward if you want because we have a model here. So, you'll see it better if you're closer to the stage. Uh, but my name is Aish Gonzalez. I am the head of product for computer science and AI with LEGO education. I'm based in Denmark where LEGO is headquartered. Uh, and I'm very excited to share a bit more about our approach to AI as well as I'll do a live demo as well of our new computer science and AI product. So, let's make this as interactive as possible. I'll I'll try to go through the slides, give you a bit of a live demo, but maybe we have time for questions as well. So I'll just start with the world is really currently obsessed with what computers are capable of. We are like talking about all the latest and greatest large language models and all the greatest technology. But I would argue that we've forgotten what kids are capable of. I think we've got so caught up in this technology deluge that we've forgotten what are the kids really capable of doing. So we did this really interesting experiment where we asked 16 kids uh from various schools to come together and define their own AI policy. This is done in the US but you can imagine this can be extrapolated to other places as well. So I'm going to share the video here. There's no audio. >> It was working earlier. >> Yeah, they they just need to turn up the audio. working on >> turn into mush because of it. >> I feel like we just need a class that will teach us how to navigate AI and make sure that our brains don't turn into mush because of it. >> Write that down. It's really important to use AI responsibly. >> Not everybody has access to AI, so only use AI if everyone can use AI. >> That's a great idea. >> AI is really empowering if you have some guidelines around it. >> AI literacy is really important. >> I'm very sorry. I'm going to play this again because I think we completely missed the beginning of it. I'm super sorry. I feel like we just need a class that will teach us how to navigate AI and make sure that our brains don't turn into mush because of it. >> Write that down. >> It's really important to use AI responsibly. >> Not everybody has access to AI. So only use AI if everyone can use AI. >> That's a great idea. >> AI is really empowering if you have some guidelines around it. AI literacy is really important. >> Okay, there's a longer video as well. I realize it's a shorter one. Please go to legoeducation.com/ai and we have like this policy that the kids came up by themselves. So AI literacy isn't about teaching children just how to use a magic box safely. It's about giving them a screwdriver and really opening up that black box, taking it apart and building it from scratch. So that is really what it is about for us. So and I would argue that even the definition that we talk about AI literacy today is not just the literacy to how to use the tools. So we talk about how kids can understand large language models, how to enter prompts, but to actually understand the fundamental concepts that underly AI at itself and what are these fundamental principles? How do machines understand the world? How do they perceive the world from the camera, from data, etc. How do they use that for representation and reasoning? How do machines learn? And I think when I say learning I mean how do they look at the probabilistic markers? How do they un see patterns in the data and make guesses based on that and then how do people use natural interaction like natural language processing or when we type prompts into into Siri or into chat GPT and what is the societal impact. So we're looking at these five different sort of lenses when we're talking about the foundations of AI literacy not just how to teach kids how to use tools. So there are a few things I think for us with AI child safety and well-being is a non-negotiable and there's a few things I want to talk about here. First in terms of safety we do not generate text or media. So we do not use generative AI at the moment we feel that currently as it stands generative AI can be made safer but not safe enough to put in the hands of kids. So we just don't use it at the moment. Uh, I don't think the move fast and break thing is a good approach when we're dealing with very vulnerable with very vulnerable children. And we do not anthropomorphize AI. What does this mean? It means we don't give AI humanlike capabilities or like get kids to think that they're interacting with another human being. I think that creates very unhealthy emotional bonds. Uh, we want AI design which is fair, that has been trained on fair model skills, understand how those models have been trained and that is accessible for all. We use universal design guidelines to ensure that it's accessible by kids with a wide range of needs and learning uh abilities. AI should be transparent. Do you understand what model cards are? So model cards describe how an AI model has been trained. Where has that data come from? What kind of people have fed into that data? What is the geographic spread of that of that information that is there in in that model? So it's really important when we talk about AI models going back to that blackbox analogy that kids don't look at AI as this kind of magical blackbox but they're actually understanding what is behind the data that drives us this model and that we respect privacy. So here we are being very practical at Lego education. You saw me briefly bring up the coding canvas which I'll show you. So it is a coding experience for the kids but everything there there is no login. No data leaves the computer to go to a cloud. It doesn't come to us. It doesn't go to a third party when they're using the AI machine. And you'll see me use with my face. I'm going to try to make that model move a little bit. It's only interested in my X and Y coordinates and my skeleton. So even when the model is being trained by the kids, it's only using XY coordinates in the skeleton is discarding any images. So kids are also being taught that you should not give your data away on all of these apps to for other AI models to train on your data. You should respect they should respect your privacy and you should protect your data, your personal information. So that is a really important principle to teach very early on with kids. So building all these principles, I'm I'm excited to introduce LEGO education computer science and AI. For those of you who want a deeper dive of this product, we have a booth as well that direction like one minute there at the LEGO booth. Go and see the models, touch them and and and interact with them as well. So, we introduced this product uh in January. It'll be available in market in April. It's part of LEGO Education's policy to bring engaging and collaborative learning experiences within today's classrooms. So last year we launched a science product and the computer science and AI product together with first Lego League. Uh I don't know if you've heard of first Lego League. It's an annual STEM competition that kids also take part in. So these are the three core products that are part of our portfolio. So I'll talk a little bit more about computer science and AI. But as we talk about core classrooms and computer science and AI, what needs to be true for this to work in a core classroom? Core classroom subjects are 40 minutes long roughly. Uh they need to align to some kind of standards coverage to curriculum. It needs to be simple for the kids. It needs to be simple for the teachers. It needs to be engaging. And that's why obviously we feel LEGO is very engaging for kids. And here's an interesting statistic on on AI literacy. 85% of teachers see AI literacy as a priority. But how many of them feel confident to teach this in classrooms? Most teachers today who are teaching who who are teaching computer science in a lot of schools I have inter interacted with are not even computer science by education. They are science teachers, math teachers, even English teachers who are trying to teach computer science. So it has to be they have to have the confidence to be able to teach this in a classroom in a 40-minute lesson. So I'm going to show you another video. Hopefully the audio works. This time is the product with a with an example of a real classroom in the US. for whatever they love, wherever they're headed in life. In a world where computer science and AI are everywhere, we help them build the skills they need to excel. >> I want to try something. I already >> Oh, yeah. >> Really cool. >> Hey, I want to build a roller coaster or something like that. >> For every teacher new to computer science or already experienced, we've got you covered. >> I did it. So this product is intended to be very hands-on collaborative and I'll get into what I mean by collaboration and and really be led by students in their exploration journey as they explore computer science. As I said for teachers, we need to meet teachers where they are. We need to meet teachers in the confidence levels they are and make it very simple for them to get started with this. So just in summary of this it it designing it for a core classroom means it needs to fit in 45 minute lessons or I think in India it's 40-minute lessons or 30 to 40-minute lessons aligned to curriculum low preparation time and it is an extensive curriculum. So I am going to focus on the AI bits today but it includes all the concepts of computer science as well before you even hit AI as well. We follow something called the 5e model uh of engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate. But I mean in a simple way the kids start with a big question like with this lesson that they have they the AI dance. So they start with how could I make my robot dance and then they go into the computer science concept of pre-trained classifiers or custom classifiers. So that's a very complex concept they're learning. Then they work in groups of four and they build this model together and then they code it. They train the AI model and then they make it work. So you're really following through this process and then they also explain this to the classroom. So they're also practicing their presentation and communication skills and then they go back and they elaborate further. So they will some kids will make the robot look fancier. They'll do some interesting things. Some will tinker with the code. So they will iterate the code and make it more engaging as well. So all kids if they're interested in computer science, they're also interested in building have something meaningful to to engage with. So across we have K to2 3 to 5 or and 6 to8 or 5 plus 8 plus and 11 plus. We have 90 lessons with over 160 hours of learning. These cover a range of topics from basics, hardware, events, sequences, loops, conditionals, variables. I don't know how many of you are computer science experts here in the room or study computer science. So we got a few people. So some of you know what I'm talking about here. But I think these are very they're meant to be very simple concepts to introduce to kids and AI and data comes at the end. These are all aligned to global standards. Uh there's a CSTS standards which and localized and to local standards as well. Keep in mind currently there are no AI standards. So we've tried to ground it in the in the data standards but we're try we're keeping an eye on the evolving AI standards as they're developing as well. But they're closely aligned to what I shared earlier. Each of these these little check boxes represents one unit and each unit includes four lessons uh where kids progressively learn through a concept and they're building as well. So they're learning a concept about AI or they're learning a concept about loops and they're building different models and at the end they it ends with a design challenge which is more open-ended. So where they can problem solve more openly they they're not given so much instructions as much as like do a project with your teammates to solve something with this concept you just learned. I talked about collaboration earlier. What does collaboration mean here? So I said that kids would work in in groups of four around these kids. In currently we see kids like learning computer science on their screen with a headphones by themselves. That is not the kids we want to see in the future. We want to see kids who are working together, coding together, building together and building these life skills that they need in the job market eventually that they'll end up in. So our vision is here. You can see the kids sitting around a table. They're building some Lego. They're coding and they're they're trying out their thing and they're really working in this project based methodology in terms of the coding canvas. So again, I think you saw this briefly. It's a Blockly based very lightweight coding canvas that allows kids to code in word blocks and then for the really little ones, it uses something called icon blocks. So it's with with those who can't even read yet. Um the lessons are really it it brings really curated blocks tied to the lesson. I must stress here on the coding canvas again no login no data transmitted from here so extremely safe for the students for the parents to know for the teachers to know nothing ever leaves the device uh it works on very low tech devices like Google Chromebooks or or on an iPad app as well and it works more or less offline I say more or less we are trying to make it fully offline as well but it's it's quite lightweight as well to support the teachers we have a teacher experience as well so the teachers have a platform where they get all of these lessons lessons. They get facilitation notes, all the resources that they need to teach in a classroom successfully. As I said, teachers lack this confidence. They need the support to teach this. So, they get all the guiding prompts. They get all the instructions that take them through this this process and helps them prepare even before they go into the classroom. So, now getting into AI. So, I'm going to try to show you a demo here as well. But how do we make AI learning hands-on, understandable, and safe for a student? So the goal here is to really provide the students with this AI literacy capabilities helping them experiment with some of these core concepts I I was mentioning earlier of perception and probabilistic thinking and logic. Uh it should be age appropriate should be safe and the result is just is AI literacy. So I think I really want to differentiate here between using AI on kids and kids learning about AI. And even in AI literacy as I said there's a difference between kids learning about tools and kids creating these tools. So I think this is really very tangible for us and really important as well. So here I'm always going to try let me do the de demo with a video first and then we can see if I can pull off the live one. So this is the coding canvas and here you can see that there's the kids are seeing the probability probability. So there's hand up hand down uh both hands up. So kids are learning like in computer science you got zeros and ones. Things are binary on and off. With AI it's it's making a probabilistic guess. It's 70 80 90% sure based on the data that is hands up or left hand up or right hand up and then based on that probabilistic guess then it's telling through the coding here if left arm up which is based on a 70% guess then run the left motor and then lift the left hand up and then put it down and similarly for the right. So they start with very simple concepts of pre-trained classifier. a model that has already been trained and from here they will then progress onto a let me just jump here first. So from this pre-trained classifier they'll jump to a custom classifier where they'll build their own model. They'll learn that the more data they feed into the model the better the model gets. They'll learn that if only one kid trains the data it won't be so accurate when his when the friend tries to use a model. So they learn about bias as well. They learned that if models are only trained with fewer people that models tend to be biased as well. And then finally, it moves on to something called body sensing where it can use real time X and Y coordinates from the student and use that to to bring emotion. So I'm going to give you a glimpse inside a classroom of how this works and I'll keep the demo for the end in case you don't have questions. It's loose the cable. You can see it though. So, just use your imagination. >> It's okay to wire. It's not good for tomorrow. Just It's fine. It's fine. So, you're getting a sense of how they're using it in the classroom. They're building, they're they're coding, and they're they're training the model as well. And that's the model that you'll see that that I'll demo in a second. So, you can see the high level of engagement as well here. The kids are having fun with it as well. So, they are it's not something like boring. It's they're trying to also un they're trying to open up this black box said and it's really bringing engagement as well to to the the to the classroom. You can see how they're sharing as well and what happens in terms of I don't know if you know what pair programming is. So two of the kids have now will spend more time on the code. Two will spend more time in the building and then they'll swap. So you're building real collaboration as well into the building and coding process. So all kids have time to code and use the AI as well. Apologies the uh the sound and work but this is also then the learning objective. So I can create a custom classifier. I can use pose data to trade a custom classifier. I can describe these. So they're learning real learning objectives as well coming out of this. And this is tied this is at the end as I mentioned of a unit of instruction. Okay. I'll move on from here. So just in in summary um Lego education computer science and AI is a solution that is impactful meaningful and relevant. So it meets teachers where they are empowering them to deliver hands-on computer science and AI learning in the classroom. It makes computer science learn and AI instruction hands-on. When I say hands-on I don't mean just practice based but actually hands-on. They're using the hands to build collaborative and and and is studentled and every student can believe that computer science is for me. I think one thing you notice as well with these models like it's not like this scary looking robot or some kind of a car only. So at LEGO we have things called play passions. It could be like Star Wars or Harry Potter but it could be flowers it could be fantasy. So even in the lessons we are trying to touch a wide range of subjects. So whether you're a boy, you're a girl, whether you're into music, you're into art, you're into dancing, you're into robots, you're into sport that you see yourself in computer science. So I think we want to see not just the nerdy kids. I would say I was a nerdy kid. I started computer science my computer science club in Delhi about 25 years ago but I think it should be appealing to all kids who want to get into computer science and AI. So this is just a summary. Let me try now to do the more difficult thing of trying to make the demo work. So this is >> Can you wait for five minutes? Give me five minutes. >> It's okay. I think I can show it from here. I think it's fine. >> Yeah. So one thing I also want to show you here by default the camera is off as well. So it's also showing kids that that's an explicit action they need to take around privacy that camera should not be on by default. When I turn it on you first see me here but then very quickly I blur away and you can see that it's only interested in my head and my stick figure. So here you can see me lifting my hands up. Actually I'm going to ask for a volunteer. Who wants to come up on stage? Come on. Do you want to come up? Okay, I've got a volunteer. Okay, we've got you can also come if you want. So what you have here is you can try lifting one hand. Sorry, just stop it. Hold it for you guys to see. So, so he's moving his hands and see as well as changing and can you see the cord as well. Thank you for being so moving the left motor and then right arm up is moving the right motor. >> Thank you. And I think it's really important kids here can also see when you hold this. >> Yeah. >> Thank you. >> So when they are also looking at things like the the probability they can see how much and it needs to cross a certain threshold for this to activate as well. >> I think that's my demo. So I would like to leave it open then for questions if do we have time for questions? Yeah. Okay. Hi. Yeah. Hey. Uh very interesting concept and I love this. So uh I'm Raghav. We are a brand technology company. We work with a lot of education institutions for gamification of learning and things like that. So one challenge which we always faces especially in Indian ecosystem is learning happens in classroom. some of those learning doesn't get translated beyond classroom and there is sometimes there's breaks when you're transferring from one stage to another. So my question is uh is there I I I didn't see this here. I just want to know beyond the box and beyond the stages is there something built into this so that the kids are able to involve or interact with it beyond the classroom. >> Yeah. So it's a good question. So Lego education's history is outside of the classroom actually. It started 30 years ago. Have you heard of Mindstorms? The the robotic solution that they like there was a hub and it had different motors and sensors. This is still working. It's going to still doing my thing. Okay. So, the history of you go here now. >> So, so we did a lot of work because we feel that we wanted to bring computer science and AI curriculum to a larger group of kids, right? But the reality is that the our products are also very much used in the robotics and enrichment and after school space for kids who have more than the 45 minutes. So kids who want to do more. A very good example I have is first Lego League. First Lego League I think I showed very briefly on the first slide is this annual competition of STEM. So kids form teams of eight and they have a science theme and a robotics challenge that they have to solve together. But we also see robotics clubs where kids will do much more than what they do in the in the class. So they build they'll build like incredible creations. We are so inspired every day. So if you go on the Lego Education YouTube channel, you'll see a lot of like cool examples of what kids can do if they're given more time and space. So we want to reach more kids. So that's why the 45minute lessons and building a model like that. But I've seen models which are much 10 times bigger and 10 times cooler than this as well. Yeah. >> Any other questions? No, cool. Thank you so much for joining. Hopefully you found it interesting as well.
