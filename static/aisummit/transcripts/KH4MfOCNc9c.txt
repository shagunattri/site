ological situation from the communicable diseases to the non-communicable diseases. We were burdened in the past several decades with diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS etc. But that's changing very fast. Today as we speak twothird of premature mortality is happening due to non-communicable diseases. Specifically talking about cancer cancer is seeing a secular increase in all types of cancers across all different demographies across all different states and union territories. So from five years back we were having around 12 lakh cases every year. It's growing year on year. Last year we had more than 16 lakh cancer cases in the country. In terms of absolute number, this is the third highest cancer burden of any country in the world after China and US. However, there is a more worrying aspect that is the mortality due to cancer. Our mortality is one of the highest in all of the countries which have a significant burden of cancer. More than twothirds of our people are dying because of cancer before they can get any treatment. Around 10 lakh people died last year. So the disease burden is seriously increasing. We in the ministry are taking steps to increase the infrastructure and treatment services across the country on a humongous scale. Just couple of decades back cancer would mean that one would have to approach either at Ames in Delhi or probably at Memorial Center in Mumbai. Those were the one or two places which were renowned for the treatment facilities. In the last few years, we have helped create 39 state cancer institute or tertiary cancer care centers across the country which have been equipped with all the high-end equipment for diagnosis, for radiotherapy, surgical oncologists, medical oncologists. All of those services are now being made available across the country. And now we are taking the step to take cancer care from these tertiary centers to the district headquarters. So in the last year's budget we announced that over the next three years we'll be taking cancer care by opening up district daycare cancer centers in the district hospitals. So that's just to give you a brief layout of cancer. Now talking about AI, I think there's no need for me to elaborate what's the importance of AI in health care in general or cancer care. That was a conversation relevant only few years back. All of us today understand that AI has a significant role to play in healthcare in general. However, it's cancer care that lends itself in a big way for adoption of AI. What are the areas in which AI can be adopted? Right from diagnosis earlier we were lacking in the country sufficient infrastructure but today we have got diagnosis radio diagnosis equipments across the country. However, there is always a shortage of radiologists. We know by using AI tools, we can do better prediction. We can do more scans can be read by radiologists in a shorter amount of time. There will be less false positives. There will be less false negatives. Some of the things which can be probably missed by by ordinary radiologist with the help of AI tools. And here I'm being very clear that AI at this juncture is not going to replace radiologists or radiotherapists. It's only going to become as a tool in their hands for doing more scans and doing accurate scans and not missing out the tumors that could have been missed out otherwise. Similarly when it comes to radiotherapy all of us know that when there's a high energy lin is there it's a costly equipment but the number of people that can be treated in one day is very limited because the treatment plan takes several hours for any radiotherapist with the use of AI those hours can be reduced into minutes and the number of people we can help is much more higher talk about enkopathology talk about any of the other aspects effects, mammography scans, so many people we can help if AI is used in the right manner. That is where I'll come to the last part. So many tools already exist. Several of you may be either working on developing those tools or would be thinking of doing something similar. The biggest challenge comes in being able to get to market in being able to sell these tools and convince the people to be using them. Now in this context I would like to share with you who are the different stakeholders in the government system and how best to navigate this challenge. We have the ministry of health and family welfare at the national level. This ministry is responsible. Our ministry has two departments. There is the department of health and family where which I represent and then there's a department of health research. So these are the two departments in the ministry. Department of health research and we have colleagues representing the department of health research. They are mainly responsible for doing the research, doing the development of tools if possible at tech transfer and more importantly where the research has been done by our young entrepreneurs by our young scientists in the private sector then how to validate those tools. So that is the domain of the department of health research. Then the department of health and family welfare which I represent we are responsible for making policies doing the procurements of these tools and rolling out them for implementation at scale in the field. That is where we have to understand that health as per the constitutional scheme being a state subject it will be the state governments who will take a lead in implementing some of the tools. But now with the national health mission we are helping the state governments financially and technically also you would have noticed that uh we have uh now several as 22 aims have been approved. So the tertiary care is also going big. So that is the landscape. So we would be very happy to work with all of the stakeholders especially the national cancer grid on ensuring that these tools which receive validation are put into implementation at scale. With that opening remark I would conclude my brief remarks. Thank you so much. [applause] >> Thank you for setting the context. U next we would uh like to invite uh secretary uh electronics ministry of electronics and IT u to come and deliver the strategic context of uh the catch grant that again was developed between the India emission and national cancer grid. Secretary Christian if I may kindly invite you to the stage. Good afternoon to all of you and uh thank you again for uh being in Delhi for the AI uh impact summit here being hosted in the parat montapam. I know many of you have traveled long distances to be here and uh we really admire and thank you for all your enthusiasm and energy. The new thing that I've learned over the last couple of days is there are large language models, small language models and now we have tiny language models. And I've decided that one of the most effective things to do in many of these contexts is to adopt being a tiny language model. And as I was coming up, I was told I can speak for four minutes. I'll try and compress that to two. So I think the important thing and uh uh the key thing here is that this is an AI impact summit. So what we are attempting to do is to have a set of things which AI can do as a technology which will actually benefit humans. human in the loop or humans at the center of this process is what is is what at least India is attempting to advocate as the key element of what we want to do. So what is being showcased in many of the stalls in the expo which I'd invite those of you who have not already seen it to go across and see is myriad solutions which basically help people whether it is in agriculture, education, health care, variety of places, governance and so on. How can it make people's lives better? How can it make it easier? And how can it make a significant difference? And as part of this entire effort, one of the challenges we have run is this um challenge relating to cancer care. How can we with the national cancer grid, how can we run, how can we find solutions based on AI to make treatment, diagnosis and various other things quicker. I understand that uh there was extensive participation and in fact last evening we gave away awards for the other three major uh challenges that we ran which was AI for all AI by her and uh um you are AI and we had there thousands of teams participating I think totally all three put together exceeded about 15,000 teams which took part in that whole process we brought it down to the final 10 which included not just participants from India India but from Thailand, Kenya, the United States and a whole host of other countries. That's the kind of impact and enthusiasm that this event has managed to generate and I'm very glad that even in as part of the NCG CAT challenge, we've been able to generate similar enthusiasm and so many people have participated. This is really what is making a difference. This is what is taking AI to the people. This is what is making a difference at the cutting edge level. And I I would not worry if I were a doctor. I'm not going to worry that my job's going. If I were a technician, I'm not going to worry that my job's going because none of those jobs are really going away. I think you'll just become better at it and uh your own productivity will go up and those with domain expertise will continue to be respected and will continue to be needed even with the advent of AI. So I think which is why I think at least in the Indian context our approach to AI the government's approach to AI is a positive confident approach that we can significantly benefit from the technology and if there is any reason that we need to work around and if there is any reason that we need to ensure that uh we have a situation where uh uh we guard against uh any negative effects of AI. we do that and that is the direction in which uh the government intends to move. Thank you once again. I shall keep my promise of this being a tiny language model and uh end my speech there and welcome again to Dr. Raabel the secretary health research. Uh thank you for having helped us with organizing this. Uh thank you all. [clears throat] [applause] So uh to sort of move on the next part is the exciting bit. So at the culmination of identification of the top 10 uh from the 299 applicants that we had got for the uh catch challenge. uh we have created a compendium you know across uh screening, diagnostics, data curation which we felt was an important gap for solutions to come up and um uh you know and and also research R&D being separately funded besides the uh you know general themes of uh treatment adherence screening and diagnostics. So to launch the compendium I would like to uh invite on stage uh S. Krishna sir is already here and uh if Kavita ma'am CCO India mission can come up [music] uh we can also call Dr. Kish uh director Tata Memorial Hospital uh Dr. Harit Chhaturi max hospitals and NCG member Dr. Rajiv Bal, Secretary of Department of Health and Research and DGICMR and Dr. Mona Dubal.

So there is an additional uh you know award announcement that we'd like to make given we have the dignitaries on the stage already. Uh we've been running the applications development initiative under which we had our first round of innovation challenge and across the thematic areas of governance climate and disaster management health and lining learning disabilities and agriculture. Over the last year after piloting, we've been able to select the final five solutions in the in the in the uh five themes of around thousand applications that were received during the process of the challenge. Uh we'd like to invite these five winners across the five themes starting with Adelat AI. Please come on stage and correct yourself. >> [music] [music] [music] >> Next. Can we call Jet on stage please? >> [music] >> Next we have [music] [music] >> [music] [music] [music] >> So for the next part we also had AI base [music] authentication challenge that was launched. in October 2025 with the objective of strengthening the integrity of [music] public examination systems through AI enabled dduplication and one to many photo verification against historical databases. Two winning teams have been identified for the deployment at the UPSC.

[music] [music] >> [music] >> Thank you respected secretaries. We now move on to the next part of the session. There's something very exciting that uh Dr. Raji Bell uh secretary of department of health and EGICMR has to share with us. I am handing over the stage to him. Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. So what I'm going to do is to make a short announcement. As you all know, it is not enough just to develop an AI model or AI tool, but also its evaluation and then its certification or approval of some kind is so important before it is used in any health system, any health sector uh program. And with that I am going to announce a partnership between India AI, National Cancer Grid, Quitta Centers for Digital Health Research, IIT Bombay, Ashoka University and the Indian Council of Medical Research, our National Institute for Digital Health Research in order to enable such evaluations and develop the the models, the mechanisms to conduct such evaluations and to make these products available for use in healthcare. So I'm really happy that this collaboration will serve as a national resource for design and conduct of evaluation studies and provide technical oversight and demo demonstrate robust evaluation pathways for AI solutions in oncology. And these as you can see the partners here each bring very different kind of expertise to the table. uh from the Ministry of Health, the ICMR uh and working along with our partners at CDSCO and the Department of Health and Family Welfare. We would like to develop such important uh to support our innov uh our regulator also to be able to approve such uh innovations. But for we have the content specialist in the national cancer grade Dr. Promesh and his colleagues are here. Uh we have Ashoka University, IIT Bombay and the India AI bringing in a lot of muscle around the whole conceptualization and building of such innovations. So together I think this requires uh bringing AI tools and digital health solutions to health care and to programs and in this case to oncology absolutely requires this kind of a multi-disciplinary partnership. So I'm very happy to announce that and to move it forward. [applause] Thank you. Okay. So, I think that was uh we'd also like to call secretary back again with the consortium partners to get a photo uh of the launch. If you could please kind kindly come. Heat up >> [music] [music] >> here. >> [music] [music] [music] >> Thank you. Kavita ma'am if you could just stay back. Kavita ma'am had been instrumental in you know developing this grant developing the mechanisms of this grant and she will set the sort of context further in how we plan to further scale the solution. I know there's um we are running short of time but it's my privilege to be here and I would like to uh welcome all our colleagues with whom we have also joined a partnership. uh but uh I just wanted to mention that the presence of all the partners over here makes sure that the we have a collective commitment for the uh advancement of responsible and evidence-based AI in cancer care which is also very important that we should have and we actually value this cross- sector partnership as we move forward from innovation to a meaningful clinical impact. In fact uh as a part of the India AI mission when we thought that we will have uh uh investments to create the enabling environment for the cross- sector specific initiatives we thought of having a partnership with um NCH and we thought of having this uh whole challenge we uh the response to the call reflects that actually uh there is so much innovation ecosystem and we received 299 applications across the country out of which having a multi-stage uh technical evaluation and clinical evaluation. We have shortlisted 35 proposals out of which these 10 solutions with uh who have actually been awarded they will be having a structured pilot and a scaleup support will be given to them so that actually the solution is not just a solution in pilot phase it is deployed state. So that is what we wanted to do it and the partnership with cancer care grid uh demonstrate that how digital innovation and public health systems can advance together through a structured collaboration. Such alignment actually strengthens transparency, accountability and scalability. In fact, the compendium uh launched today will also uh has been giving up very detail about the 10 promising solutions and we have also announced a framework with secretary DH announced that we will be making sure that all the solutions are institutionally grounded and technically um validated and are meant for design for scale and I wish all the 10 solution players uh best of luck and I want to make sure that the solutions are implemented And ultimately the benefit for whom we are thinking that is the citizen should be given so that we are able to mitigate the most uh disease which is uh in our country which is cancer and we should have uh people more coming out of this disease. Thank you very much. >> Okay. So now finally we have uh come to the panel discussion. I would kindly like to invite Mr. Sami Pachari from WHO to come to the stage. Mr. Anai Jan from JPG. Mr. Mona, Miss Monadul from ICMR, Dr. C. Promesh uh from Tata Memorial Hospital. And Dr. Harit Chhaturi from Max Healthcare. Please to come on stage. Heat. [music] Heat. I think there's only one word that I can use to describe where we are right now and what's going on. Um, marvelous. Um, but I'll use another word to describe this particular panel here as well. Unprecedented. Um so thank you very much uh for joining me on this panel. Um um I think over the last 3 days that or 2 and 1/2 days now that we've been at the AI summit itself a lot of themes have started to emerge. Um, and I thought that we would perhaps try and look at those themes from the perspective of where we are from the uh the NCG catch awards themselves and try and understand what this means um from a truly global perspective itself. Um, and so perhaps Dr. Mona I will start with yourself. Um, right. I think one of the things that we've been talking about is on how there is a template that is being established now for the world as far as not just digital health but digital health and AI at scale is concerned right um now we've been talking about this as to how India can truly be a lead and can truly start to establish this template and collaborate ation with the global south itself. Um so perhaps my first question to yourself is that from from your perspectives right there is a systems lens to all of this. Um there's obviously the infra and the compute perspective that the India mission brings. There is obviously the perspective of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare from a health systems perspective and there's obviously the learning and the knowledge perspective of it from a particular ICMR perspective. But how do you see this template really evolving um and us truly charting a way forward for the global south? >> Yes. Thanks. >> Uh thank you Anuna for the question. Um I think there has been a lot of discussions for the past few days and u it has been truly been enriching experience. I've been on various panels. First I think we have to realize that uh uh this was the first of the kind. I think uh the preparation for this summit had started way back like I think for past one year and when the catch grant come came in I think uh a lot of collaborations initially had started. I think the first was like we had the IIT Mumbai and the NCT grid and the quota foundation and lot of private hospitals also supporting this entire ecosystem had come together but at the same time when we were talking I think what was missing is the validation piece which probably is where we come in and where the government comes in. I think before even we reach anywhere we have to deploy any uh any of the things any of the solutions that we are talking about the validation has to be done in such a manner that a vendor feels comfortable taking it on. So this is where this entire concept had started to come in and the systems approach was there but even before the systems approach we have to make sure we have the right kind of people who are doing the validation. So [snorts] understand until you have the right kind of people doing the validation whatever you might do u because we have lot of solutions who come in and when they come in and they say okay we need validation we have to ensure that the people who are actually doing it have the right set of people who have made the solution I think this was one of the criteria also when we are looking at teams do they have do they even have the right expertise to come into that second is uh when they come to us uh and we take it on because it's not that like we have all the solutions we can take it on we have to models that will actually we feel are going to scale up and have the right mix of people. So this is where we had come in and we are putting in that systems approach now. So now uh even for what kind of designs that we are going to be doing this is again a learning experience for us and we will all grow together. First is of course the RCTs that has been the general trend that has been doing but since RCTs are a bit more long-standing and we need a shorter time period we are going to see how we are going to take them like in a shorter time period so that we can give back to them. These are the problem statements and this is how you want to improve before we take on a bigger and a large scale uh systems. So this is an entire consortium partnership that is going to become uh this thing and of course with the south south partnership I think we are leading I think the yesterday we had the launch of the strategy document also we were the first ones to start the strategy and there is a entire pillar on research and innovation. So this is where our role is going to now step in and we can take this forward and we can lead it from forward. How we can take these partnerships and how we can actually partner with the technical experts bring the public health perspective the international perspective I think who is on board and the evaluation partnerships and bring the best practices to India and how you implement to the global south. >> Thanks Dr. Ma. I think very well said. Um right I think setting a template for evaluation of these solutions perhaps is the prime basics right I mean we've spoken time and again that unless governance and trust and verifiable governance and verifiable trust starts to come into the system anything is very difficult to systematize at scale and so so thank you for for sharing that um maybe Sam I'll I'll move to you a little bit right and um I think the second theme that we've been hearing about is uh is is in the name of the summit itself, right? It's the impact summit, right? It's the AI impact summit. But I want to take on a slightly different spin to what we've been hearing. We've been talking a lot about moving pilots as far as AI is concerned to scale, right? So going from proof of concept to proof of implementation. I want to stretch it a little bit forward and say what does it really mean to get to proof of outcome and proof of real impact as well. Um and so from your experience of having now had eyes on the entire world uh in many ways, right? What is that magic formula really look like for solutions like AI um um solutions that maybe here at the NCG catch awards or others that we heard awarded today as well to really start to get to that outcome level impact uh in many ways. I think so. >> Thank you. This is Yeah, it's fine. Thank you. Uh good afternoon everyone. Magic formula you asked, right? There's nothing there's no I mean if if we are living in the in the gimmick of having a magic formula, it won't work. But you said a very nice word at the beginning, template. And I think going back to the roots of technology, that's the basic format, right? What a template has been set here. You're seeing classic model of governance. I mean scale. Yes, technology exists, technology grows and it's always available. But the way technology grows as we've seen from the other side is it's not the developers who decide that it's the users who decide that. Right? So it was very well said uh in the uh earlier discussion as well that let the users, the patients, the end users decide what can be scaled. You have to make the technology so capable that it can become that value for the users. And I think that's the basic template is saying and I think the template has been set. I'm really uh humbled to be part of this discussion and this panel and this impact summit which is really honing in getting in people from the medicine side from the health side from tech side all together and making them talk to each other and the awards were so inspiring because you had a combination of the of the clinical partner and the technology partner sitting in I think that's the template we're looking at here from the one side the the supply side we creating the right ecosystem I think there are three factors that I would I would hone in again here the first One is governance and I think that's we seeing the template here and the template why I keep on re saying that the copy paste formula that was the first thing we learned in computer uh sciences copy paste I'll add a third layer to it is format as well right because you have to localize these discussions you can't just copy and paste them but you have to format it to the local settings so that's the first stage of any of these the scale part so so governance is the key part of it and you can do the copy paste and format for that that perspective when I say governance the India AI has been so so instrumental. They've brought the ministries together. They've made this this happen and I think this is a start to take this work forward. The second one Dr. Müah mentioned evaluations and when I say evaluations it is understanding what works. It's not the just the clinical setting of evaluation that's the important part but the operational evaluation and the economic evaluation of these things so that they add the value proposition to that whole perspective in the of how we can scale it up right and the third one which is most impactful is is the end user I mean like whether it's actually helping the end as I said the the user in this whole perspective keeping them at the center of it I think is the core part of how we can scale up interventions one thing we have been very focused around around governance implementation all this is is and this is a plea I've been putting in all the sessions is let's not create solutions let's look at the problem and I think that's a big area in the AI space where we have facing e- health digital health we have failed in this one please let's look at the at the problem statements look at the the pain points in the health systems and address them and there's also an opportunity to be creative so it doesn't mean that we stop at being just looking at the painoint systems AI does have the facility of of helping out areas which haven't been done in the past. You're seeing DR which is diabetic retnopathy which is a vision based technology which is actually helping address diabetes in the health systems which has never been done before. So I think these are some of the points I would like to highlight here. Um and stop there. Thank you. >> So so Samir just keep the mic on for one more minute right. I I think it's it's it's great to hear the positive sides of things right as to and you spoke about governance user first um making sure that you remain problem first and not solution first in in many ways uh but there are pitfalls in this journey as well right and so I I perhaps both to you and Dr. Mona, one more piggybacking question. What are the pitfalls that we must all remain aware of um as we set out on this template finalization journey if I can if I can say that. >> Thank you. No, it's great point and I think we have seen an example. Verticalization is something that we have seen has been a big pitfall, right? Everyone wants to do the same solution or different solution. My solution is slightly different to this one. It's better. I think in the space of AI the pace at which the technology is improving and enhancing we have to work together and I was so humbled to see the announcement from ICMR bringing that collaboration together at the local level at the grassroot levels at the global level I think that what's need to h what needs to happen in this space we are seeing the clear way that the technology is not the challenge here it's the approach and the system that we're doing it and I think verticalization has always been the different and I think that's something that we need to fight off in the space so thank you that's my I think uh in the interest of time I think I agree with Sam but uh I think that's all I would say because I believe that we have two other panelists that we would like to >> so and I was reserving this for Dr. Promesh and Dr. Dr. because I think there is a separate kind of systematization that must also happen as we're talking about AI right it's not just inside health systems that's perhaps a little bit of a macro lens but if we really start peeling the onion then it has to get systematized within individual institutions themselves within professional bodies like the NCG itself right um and so perhaps a question to both of you and maybe Dr. Promesh we'll start with yourself is how do you see this happening at the NCG at scale and how do you see taking the discourse that arises from the implementation of AI solutions at NCG perhaps to other professional bodies both within India and outside as well. Yeah, I'll just I'll just carry on from where uh Samir left off and uh he made a really important point about u looking for problems first and then the solutions. I look at AI the same way. I don't think because we have AI then we try and find AI solutions for healthcare or for cancer care. I would flip the system around and say that we have problems in healthcare and cancer care and let's find whatever solution it might be. AI might be one of those tools that we use. And when you look at the entire burden of cancer in India, we have 15 lakh patients, 11 lakh of them dying of uh cancer every year, there's an Ernstston Young report which says that you need to multiply the human workforce by anywhere from 1.4 times to 2.6 times just to meet today's requirement not to speak of the projected requirement in 10 or 15 years. And you realize that you're faced with a major problem where conventional solutions will not work. And that is how the national cancer grid got created in an effort that rather than each cancer center working in silos trying to address a common problem and trying to be competitive and combative which is the typical way hospitals want to make it. Leaderships of most hospitals want to make their hospital the best hospital in the world and it automatically creates a rift between themselves and other hospitals or other care providers. And what we really need to work towards if we believe in public health and in doing good for mankind is to actually narrow that gap. This might seem completely counterintuitive because what you're effectively saying is your aim is not to just get better. You want to actually get some of the less resourced centers get even better and narrow that gap. So I think that's a fundamental mental block which we need to get over and thanks to the belief and the leadership of several cancer center hospitals in the country and I believe that this only is an exemplar for other areas in healthcare. Today we have 400 cancer organizations working together towards a common goal. Forgetting about the fact temporarily that I want my center or I want my hospital to be the best in the world but looking towards that reducing that mortality to incident ratio which uh uh which uh Mr. Vijera spoke about in the beginning. I think laying the fundamental uh uh tools for that making sure that you create an ecosystem which will work towards that is what we've created through the national cancer grid. >> Thanks Dr. information and Dr. Chhatrai maybe I can come to you and maybe I want you to go even deeper into it right u let's take the perspective of max hospitals right and you've got a team of doctors there across India now right what do you say to each one of them how do they institutionalize this within their practices and what does an institution like a singular hospital group then do in order to enable that >> fantastic so frankly the practice of medicine like all sciences is not a magic so As Romesh said it has to be consistent. It has to be uniform and at NCG at max at all institutions. So typically institutions are institutions because there commitment of quality commitment of a certain process and that will maintain. So at max or wherever we are we all consistently work together. While I agree that and prevention we all see this that we all are inherently competitive inherently competitive and that is where we have reached so far. So in that pursuit we keep doing things and outdoing things. But NCG and several other plat platforms we come together for larger purpose and larger good and that is what is the in the larger interest and I would say that AI has will have transformative power especially oncology because it is I believe the most complex of multi-disiplinary approaches so while all practice of medicine is complex this is unique in several ways because surgical medical radiology path so many disciplines have to come together and something like AI can actually integrate all this very well for live solutions, immediate solutions and short while back PH was mentioning that ASCO has worked with Google to create something. So a lot is coming up if that can reach every corner of this country it will be so powerful right so so much valuable to all of us so I think we have to work together towards that go Dr. Chhatwari again I want you to hold on hold on to that mic right um we're now taking a leap of faith right we're we're we're jumping time we're in 2027 we're in Geneva at the AI impact summit what's the one success that you want to look after uh and look back at and be able to stand on the stage and stay there 12 months down the lane >> I think access to healthcare will improve significantly access to quality healthare not just healthare quality healthare because all this will become as as on a smartphone and if that is going to happen can you imagine that uh where people are not able to diagnose not able to get access to a tumor board a medical approach all those inputs will come handy I the other thing which I keep telling my colleagues and I all believe that it is high time that we use these modern AI models as coaches for ourselves and we learn learn in the process we are all unique human beings and as we put all that data together we will evolve what is my next level and together for larger purpose So I think that one milestone for me is access to quality healthcare will actually improve significantly >> and Dr. Promesh what what what about yourself right AI impact summit 2027 Geneva what do you want to be able to stand and say >> I agree completely with what Harit mentioned about uh improving access and I just want to throw out some numbers here so the requirement for pathology diagnostic pathology in any developed country in the world is one pathologist per 15 to 20,000 population in subsaran Africa the number is one is 2.3 million now you're not going to create 100 times times the number of pathologists that currently exist in subsaran Africa and get them to diagnose quality pathology tomorrow. The only way we can do that is to be disruptive, be looking at solutions such as AI, but do so in an ethical and responsible way. And this is something that's underestimated quite often. If you have u a a data set which is entirely made of uh of high- income country uh images, they may not necessarily apply to other settings. And I I think even something as simple as your pulse oxyter which malfunctioned quite substantially during COVID because it was put on someone with a darker skin as compared to someone with a fairer skin on which it was validated is an example of that. So ethical responsible AI improving access to healthcare. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for giving us a patient listen. I think that's all the time that we had for um but just bring it back right I'm a big believer in vision right and if anything this has been uh a teaser of the vision that India has and that can be set for the global south and perhaps for the world um so thank you again um you know really really appreciate all of you spending your time with us but thank you Thank you Anun for that rockstar moderation and we need to close and move out very quickly as the PM will be coming in a while and therefore this house needs to be cleared out for security. Thank you everybody again joining for joining us the India guys. Thank you.
