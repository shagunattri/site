is scaling trusted AI for 8 billion plus people. Uh right [snorts] at the beginning of this session, we'll be having a photo opportunity. So to all the panelists and keynote speakers, please uh be seated on the chairs which are right here. I can see Dr. MKkesh Agi Bradith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, Bipolha, uh Umesh Sajv and Apernna Baba. Please be seated here. We'll take a photograph first before we start. Viple please be seated. We are waiting for Umesh. Um Saj Dave, CEO and co-founder of Unifor will be joining me any any moment and uh then we plan to start this conversation. The best part of a packed hall Dr. Agi is that there are it's an audience which is here to listen to all of you and there'll be multiple takeaways and perhaps we'll also open the house for a few questions because these are AI enthusiasts young entrepreneurs who are looking at this domain with lot of curiosity and uh with lot of u innovation at the same time innovation ideas That's going to be the big takeaway of this India AI summit that is being held in Bharat Mandepam as we wait for Umesh Sajv to join us. Should we Aik Yeah. So should we have the photo opportunity first or uh how do you want to? Yeah. Okay. So let's have Okay. Omesh is here as well. Please join us. Let's have the photo opportunity and then we begin the entire conversation. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to this US India strategic partnership forum panel on scaling trusted AI for 8 billion plus people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are living through a once in a century technological inflection point. AI is no longer a lab experiment, a boardroom buzzword or a chat b a chat bot on your phone. It is fast becoming what is being seen as perhaps the operating system of our economies, our institutions and our societies. So the real question before us today is not whether AI will scale because it will and it already has. The question is can we scale trusted AI? The emphasis is on the word trust and AI for 8 billion people globally. This is both a challenge and the opportunity. And as AI reshapes education, healthcare, agriculture, finance, national security and the future of work, the stakes could not be higher. That's why trust without access is meaningless. The next billion innovators may not sit in Silicon Valley or Bengaluru's tech parks. It may come from small towns from where I come from where Vippula is from or classrooms or farms of startups we haven't yet imagined. [gasps] So welcome to this special con conversation and to set the stage and context may I please invite Dr. MKkesh AI president and CEO of USISPF. Dr. Agi has over 20 years of success in powering business expansion globally. He's a recipient of JRD Tata Leadership Award and the Praasi Bharti Saman award. He advises Fortune 500 CEOs globally and is a distinguished thought leader on US India strategic relations. Dr. Agi, welcome. >> Please go ahead. [applause] >> Well, good afternoon. I know we have a time of 40 minutes for all the panelists and the Q&A. Uh let me welcome you to the uh this sessions getting the trusted AI for 8 billion people. One question which we don't need to ponder on that is AI is going to be pervasive is going to impact you in every aspect of life from education to healthcare to transportation what you buy what you sell. So that's a given. The question you have to ask is is will AI percolate down and and create an environment which is equal. Uh when I use the word equal will there be a feudal system if we don't address this now coming in the AI where few are controlling the trends the power of AI. So I think from that perspective we have to look at how we can bring this to 8 billion people and plus more moving forward. We do have very eminent speaker. You have Brad Smith vice chairman of Microsoft who has taken the lead thinking in this arena itself. And then we have uh basically Aperna from Zoom. We have uh uh Umesh are driving Unifor again one of the agentic AI companies and Bipple with Rubric itself and we're delighted they could join us but the question we still have to ask is is what direction AI will go. Uh it's not about just trust it's about who controls it and how it benefits rest of the society. So welcome and look forward to that conversation. Thank you, Dr. Agi. I now invite Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, to deliver the keynote address. Brad Smith joined Microsoft in 1993, and he leads a team of roughly 2,000 professionals located in 54 countries and operating in more than 120 nations. The New York Times has called Bradith a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large. The Australian Financial Review has described him as one of the technology industry's most respected figures. Brad Smith, welcome. >> Well, thank you. I think I'll just stand for my 8 minutes. And first, thank you for the opportunity to be here. I have eight minutes to talk about how we're going to reach 8 billion people, a billion people per minute. [laughter] And of course when I look out and see all of you and I know that you hear that I joined Microsoft in 1993. I know that there are people here who were not born in 1993. I have been coming to India for many years. So at least for some of you I was in India before you. I want you to know that. But let's talk about the challenge we face because AI is either going to close the great divides that exist in the world or it will make those divides even wider. And I think that is the reality we must confront head on. In a sense, the great story of generative AI only began 3 years and three months ago when chat GPT was released. We're in the early years, but I would say that these early years are not altogether going well. Our aid AI diffusion report showed that at the end of 2025, 25% of the global north, the working age population there is using AI, but only 14% in the global south. 25 to 14. That is the new divide. And it's getting worse, not better. In the second half of 2025, the growth rate in the north was 1.8% but in the south only 1.0. The first thing I would say is we have to address this with urgency. When you look out at the world today, what is the greatest divide that exists on our planet? I would argue it is the economic divide between the global north and the global south. And what we should recognize is that that divide in my opinion was fundamentally created by unequal access to technology, specifically electricity. The great generalpurpose technology that for more than a century drove industrialization and prosperity across the global north before it really took off in the global south. we run the risk of repeating that and we cannot afford to do so. Now I will say on the other hand if we can do better and we should this may be the best opportunity in the 21st century for the global south to catch up and have catchup economic growth. So how do we build a better future? Well, it starts by bringing the infrastructure to the global south that the global south needs. That means data centers. It means connectivity and it means electricity. And it means all three of them together. That's why Satia Nadella when he was here in December announced that Microsoft would be spending 70 17 billion here in India. It's why this morning we showed that we're on pace to spend $50 billion by the end of the decade in the global south bringing AI here. That's not nearly going to be enough. We need to harness private capital. We need to harness public capital. We need to generate demand that will unleash more capital to build the infrastructure that the global south needs. That is job one. But if all we do is job one, then our task will be woefully incomplete. So there's other things we need to work on as well. The most important of which is skilling. History shows that major technologies that transform economies are fundamentally dependent on spreading the skills across the economy needed to put them to use. That happened for computers and computer science. It's what enabled India to build such an important software industry. We need to bring AI skills to the global south and India is I think a focal point for this activity. It's why last year we announced at Microsoft that we would bring AI skills to 20 million people across India. It's why this week through Microsoft Elevate, we're launching a new program to bring skills to 2 million educators so that they can then bring those skills to their students. So, infrastructure and skills get us started, but they don't ensure trust. How do we do that? Well, I would say it's three additional things. First, we have to make sure that AI works as well in every language as it does in English. And today, it does not. That's why one of the steps that I think you're seeing this week, including a step that we're supporting, is all about providing better support for multilingual model capability. Investing upstream in more data and data sets. Investing to improve tools that will work in multiple languages. Investing in content providence so that they reflect the linguistic diversity of the world. multi-ingual capability that's essential. A second thing is to do more and to do better to ensure that AI solves the practical problems and realw world needs across the global south. Ultimately, it is the applications layer that will best stimulate demand for every layer of the stack. And here too, I think we're seeing important steps this week. Microsoft is joining others, including across Africa and in South Asia, to address food insecurity, to provide better forecasting to prevent famine, to strengthen agricultural productivity. That is just one of the thousands of realworld needs that we can address. And finally, we need to ensure responsible AI. That's why the steps being taken here at this summit this week are important steps that help continue to nudge the world to better global governance. And ultimately, I think for all of us to remember that even while governments debate whether to adopt laws, even while governments disagree about what kinds of laws they want to adopt, every day, every one of us who works in any company that is building AI can always keep in mind we don't need a law to enable us to do what we know is right. We need to protect children as a world of AI takes off. We need to think about the future of work and jobs. In short, to earn the world's trust, we have a lot of work to do. And the only way to do it is to build on that one word that is part of this organization's name and this event partnership. We need to work together. Certainly on behalf of Microsoft, we are excited to be part of this effort to be here with all of you to take steps this week and close the AI divide. Thank you. [applause] >> Thank you, Brad Smith. You actually summed it up quite well in 8 minutes. how to scale it up. So we'll try and make this session a little different. Uh the highlight certainly would be you the audience who'll be asking questions to the panelists because we'll try and make it more interactive and I'm going to also ensure that the mic reaches you the mic has to reach the audience. We'll be opening the floor to questions after I've asked one question each to everyone who are here. Pipula, CEO and chairman and co-founder of Rubric. He's an entrepreneur, engineer, venture capitalist. He's the CEO and chairman and co-founder of Rubric. Um his story is fascinating which begins from a small town in Dhanbad and goes straight to Silicon Valley. Then you have Aperna Baba. I'm particularly excited because you have another woman in the panel. So she gets the opening comments and also the closing comments. >> [snorts] >> Aperna Bawa is is COO of Zoom and Zoom everybody knows and you use it as much. We have uh Umesh Sajdev CEO and co-founder of Unifor. It is one of the world's largest AI native endtoend AI and data platform companies. Uh let's begin with you Aperna the opening comment. uh you have more than uh 8 minutes in all but uh you can talk about the scalable AI and the fact the emphasis we have been saying about trusting AI so that the digital divide is reduced thank you so much for having me um you know I've been thinking about this question so much actually by the way I'm also Indian I'm south Indian I'm familian you wouldn't know that from my last name Ba my maiden name is Sini Vasan So I also I didn't come from a small town just Bangalore but um you know it's it's nice to be back in India. Every time I come here I get off the plane and I look like everybody else. It's wonderful. I love it. [laughter] Um and I feel so much at home even though my family will tell me my Hindi and my Tamil sucks but you know I'm I'm working on it every day here. I get better. Okay so digital divide and how to bridge that gap. Well, at Zoom something we have been focusing on and actually when I was looking at the posters with Pradhan Mantri Modi on them and talking about this AI action summit he is telling us that this is an inclusive summit and this is all about economic progress and you could not have a company that is more aligned to inclusivity and economic progress such as Zoom. Who are we? We enable my mother-in-law who is 83 and I tell this story all over the place because she absolutely is a fact-based story. She absolutely uses Zoom all day long. She has the free account. I can't get her to upgrade. We also have Fortune 50 to1 that uses Zoom. It's the same platform. And how do we do that? We do that because we're easy to use. And when we first started, we had this tagline, it just works. you know that when you're on vacation in the mountains in India and or you're you know working hard in some corner of the globe that you can turn on any kind of Wi-Fi any kind of network and your video quality and your audio quality will be great and you add that to AI so you know us for meetings you don't know that we're a full collaboration platform perhaps maybe if you're an enterprise you do underpinning that entire platform is a very strong AI backbone that is seamless and so for us using the same principles of design. How did it work? So we we our focus on our product designers is our our CEO and our founder says this there can be no hidden logic and what does that mean? That means you as a user should be able to use our product and not have to figure something out with a PhD degree. You should be like my mother-in-law and be able to troubleshoot herself and figure herself out when she gets kicked off of a call or whatever the case may be or a meeting. Um, you should that that design principle of no hidden logic and when you translate that to AI, what did chat GP2 chat GPT do when Brad Smith referenced Chat GPT? What did it do? It uses natural language to actually democratize AI so that anybody could pick it up and use it and get answers from it. And that is going to be the critical thing. How do we as technology players make it so easy to use that the billions and the billions of people who may not be that tech educated, that techsavvy can pick it up, use it. You have small and mediumsiz businesses, solarreneurs all the way to giant companies like Lens Cart and Bajage and all those folks that use Zoom today. How do you get them equally to be able to pick up AI, use it instantaneously and drive productivity from it? And that to me is reaching every 8 billion person here in India and telling them that AI has a spot or you have a spot within this AI infrastructure and you can also drive economic progress for yourself and by the way that increases GDP for the country. So that that would be my my biggest pitch is to to make things super simple, super easy and not forget that it has to be a full-scale technology. >> Yes. So AI cannot be about a handful of tech giants. It has to be about AI for all. Something Prime Minister Modi has been emphasizing on democratizing AI and making it reach small towns of India. So [snorts] Whipple uh in terms of the role, what do individuals have to do in order to be part of this AI, you know, euphoria? >> First of all, thank you so much for this opportunity. I always like a standing room only. So good that we have a small room so that everybody is standing. Uh the way I contextualize AI, if you look at the history of economic development, we went from agradian economy into industrial economy into knowledge economy and then now we are entering a new economy what I call intuition economy. >> Okay? Because everything that is knowledge and that is in the past AI will actually operate on it create workflows and give you complete solution. So where do we fit in human beings? We fit in to do intuition work where we connect new dots that has not been connected yet and then as soon as you connect new dots then it becomes codified language and knowledge and then AI will operate on it. What does it mean for us individuals? What we have to do is we need to understand and learn what AI is capable of. Good news is that a country such as India and somebody like me who came from a small town where language is a barrier. I studied in Hindi now you can speak to computer and program it in your own natural language. You don't need to learn typing. You need don't need to learn any C or C++ or Java as a language. You can program computer in English or in your own spoken language and you can operate on it. But the question is that how do you create value as an individual now the world's knowledge is at your fingertips. As I often say a kid growing up in Palo Alto has the same knowledge of the world as somebody growing up in Patna. So when you have a situation where the knowledge is no longer a barrier, how do you as an individual using your own native language program computer to envision a new world to connect new dots? How do you become a solo entrepreneur where you can create products and services that you can deliver to your community, to your city, to your state, to your country and most importantly it is amazingly enablement for everyone. If you are 40 years old and you didn't have a good education doesn't mean that you can fall behind because now you can program computer in your own language understand how it responds and create value out of it and value creation is many many things if you look at India with 1.4 4 billion population. Educational services is not consistent and uniform in every part of India. Healthcare is not consistent or uniform. Think about information agriculture. There are just so many verticals, industry verticals where you need to deliver products and services using AI. So I feel like it is an incredibly uh amazing opportunity for all of India to rise. The question is do you have access to the factories of intelligence which is the new data center and with the government of India creating data center tax breaks and 150 billion investment it is it will open up a lots of opportunities. So I'm very excited. >> Yes. So the fact here is that India is hosting we are right here in Bharat Mandapom. The message is loud and clear. We are the voice of global south but we are also prepared to look for perhaps localized solutions to global challenges. It will be about us right here in New Delhi in small towns of India where the next big AI innovation will be coming from. Omesh. >> So uh once again great to be here. Thank you for the question. Um you introduced me and my company Unifor as one of the world's largest AI native data and AI platform. We are headquartered in Palo Alto. But for most people in this room who may not be aware, where was Unif founded? In an incubation lab in IIT Madras. >> Fantastic. In 2008 when Gen AI wasn't a word and AI wasn't a word, two of us, my co-founder sitting in the front row, we were incubating an AI company out of India which is now headquartered in Silicon Valley [applause] and serves 2,500 customers. >> That's certainly a vision. >> That's exactly the vision. >> Yes, >> I think our opportunity in India, we have to be very clear the role India wants to play in this AI ecosystem. At this moment there are two countries which are running the race super hard and India is not one of them. Those are US and China. Whether it's LLMs, whether it's GPUs, whether it's data centers, India's certainly woken up. This week is a great example. But India has an opportunity to be the third wheel in this race and that will be India as a leader for AI diffusion, for adoption of AI, for applications of AI. I argue that you know we talk about how will AI be trusted. Let's start by assuming it's already trusted. The same chat GPD that a startup founder in Silicon Valley by the name Irwin who creates perplexity has access to the same model is available to everyone in this room and it's what we make of it. The same model that Unifor uses is available to every startup founder, every developer in India. Now yes there will be servs. Yes, there will be sovereign AIS coming up, but this is the moment to let a thousand flowers bloom. When I go to Europe, I hear, you know, this almost deafening sound about, you know, regulation and the European act. That is one way of stifling innovation. Right now, we haven't even scratched the surface. We haven't even figured out what this technology can do for business, for individual, for consumer. And the way this technology is developing, it is unprecedented. There is no technology that has moved as fast as AI which means our way of regulating should be reactive at that pace as opposed to worrying about it even before something good happens and then putting the brakes for 1.4 billion people. So I would say the opportunity is let there be the next 10,000 uniforms in the next 5 years globally leading different areas of AI with applications with adoption for every one server local LLM there should be 5,000 AI application companies and that's how India will be in the top three. >> Okay let's open the floor to questions please raise your hand. >> Yes sir. Yes. >> Hello. Uh good good afternoon all. Uh this is Vijay from cuts international. It's a global public policy research advocacy organization. Uh is it not true that uh big tech companies from all across the world are trying to find out uh return on investment on for their large large language models LLMs and you know this scale which Brad was also talking about you know it can be found in all global south and emerging countries uh you know is is not the case of a perfect marriage between the two. Yeah. So the question of ROI in AI who will take that anybody it is definitely something I would say that um and Biba will probably agree with this that your your boards are asking all of us um we're not super huge we're not a hyperscaler by any stretch of the imagination but our board is asking this of us and I know that you know the shareholders are going to eventually want to get paid for all this capex investment that is happening. So it's definitely a very fair question. I would say it's still in the nent stage when you have a burgeoning technology and you want to have people adopt you definitely have to start thinking about ROI building your models but you also don't want to discourage uplift and I think for now uh for example I'll I'll tell you we have even within the the most difficult thing for a tech company is the technologists automatically gravitate towards this but you have a good 50% of the rest of the folks who aren't technologists that need to the company work. And by the way, they're also responsible for things like trust and safety, privacy, security. They're careful. They're just careful people. They don't necessarily want to turn on the AI and make it work. But you have to have a forwardleaning edge. You know that it's going to change your life, your company's world, even in these some of these sectors where you know sovereignty or protection of information is so important. And so it's very very important that you have a forwardleaning edge. And I think we're still in that stage right now. There is a cognizance that right now maybe it is difficult to prove the ROI but in this sort of early stage if you hang back you might just be left behind and I think that's something that is reflected in the the rationale from boards and shareholders all across the world. >> Dr. Agi do you want to weigh in on this? I think you have to look at the the strategy is more about land grab. Basically, the more you put in and grab more land, the better chances you have that you won't get much competition coming through. In my opening comment, I use the word feudalism. What we are seeing is is few companies will control both from the hardware perspective both from a data center perspective and an LM perspective and I think that's where the money is pouring in you're building the walls so others can't come in and I think that's where what Umesh and uh basically Bipul said that the chance India has focus on is in the app side let's not miss that boat itself we can't compete on the LLMs We can't compete on the basically hardware side but we have an opportunity and that's where I think skilling is going to be very critical for the country to compete from that perspective. >> I'm going to take five questions in all. So please all of you raise your hands. So please pass on the mic. >> While you're waiting though but MKkesh if for some reason someone could figure out how to make it much much much much much cheaper that would be technology anybody would want. So all of you folks who are developers are thinking about how to do this better. That's the challenge. >> Yeah. Good afternoon to everybody. Excellent presentation made by all of them. Question I need to ask Dr. MKkesh G because he's the senior most man and most experienced on the board. You know that the AI race on the top already is on as Ume G very rightly alluded to that first two seats have already been reserved US and China. India has already taken a leap of faith. This AI summit is I think testimony to that. Do you think realistically speaking you know beyond the leap of faith does India deserve to be there and will India reach there and if you see there India reaching there how far are we there? Thank you. >> Well it's too early to put the white flag and say we're defeated. I think that'll be the wrong approach in the whole process. I think we have to work from the position of strength and the strength comes from the the uh I would say the intellectual labor force the country has when you look at uh I was looking at some data by by 2030 almost 20% of the world's digital workers will be out of India and if we start focusing on the app side apps which are basically basically innovating quick drug research innovating in every aspect I think that's where the solution and the lead will come in hardware will become the plumbing part will become the plumbing part the solutions will come from the app side and I think that's where India has the opportunity so I would not say India has lost the race India has an opportunity to take the lead on the app side >> okay we'll combine questions now please go ahead one more yeah >> so last year I visited USA first time because of ASU plus GSP summit I got opportunity to meet Jennifer Dodna who won 2020 gene editing nobel prize the surprising thing is that in that one building 18 noble laurren are seated okay if we talk about history of USA Europe whatever the country the basis science and a deep tech so is telling that already we are we we have accepted that we are on a third position or whatever the way so upcoming 5 10 20 50 100 year but We have to do something in a science regarding mindset, regarding education. What is the change required for India? You all you all are aware about that particular ecosystem. >> Pass on the mic to this uh girl as well. She can ask the second question. We'll take the two together. Go ahead. Yeah. Uh so this is a from AW funds. What I want to ask is about the safety as you say that safety and privacy should uh be taken as second concern but recently claude safety officer resigned saying world is in peril because of AI. So what are your comments and what are the precautions we should take to have a safety and privacy issues solved and uh not the not let the AI take over the world. Okay. >> Um so yes so please if you can respond. So let me take the first question and then maybe for safety I can pass it on to uh Bipple from a security standpoint. Uh I think there's a lot of talk this week about India being the AI application AI adoption leader. There is a second area where India is already leading in AI and I think we must not ignore it. There was a comment made of one single building with X number of Nobel laureates. If you think about all the leaders of those big tech companies or any number of AI companies in the seauite, the single most concentrated nationality is Indian-Americans or Indian or Asian people. [applause] So India is and will be the biggest talent exporter for AI for the whole world. If we believe this technology will dominate for the next two to three decades, most of the talent needed a large percentage of it will come from India. All right. Now, how do we take it to the masses? Jensen Hang of Nvidia has said this and many others have said this that you shouldn't worry about your job being taken by AI. You should really worry about your job being taken by somebody who uses >> AI better than you. And I think that message starting with this week if that message starts to go to our tier 2 tier three towns to every school every student that talent leadership that India has the opportunity that will put us in the front and I will you know say one more thing there was a comment made on ROI there was a comment made on you know not equal partnership between big tech and India with all due respect there's a reason Brad Smith is here this US big tech invested 150 billion last year. They need to generate at least 600 billion of revenue to make that capex investment worth it. All of those big tech know that unless this 1.4 billion population starts to adopt AI and use AI, their investment won't be met. And so we have power, we have leverage. Let's not forget that. >> Yes. So uh perhaps US and China may have taken the lead but how long will they be on position one and two? That is the question. Yeah please go ahead. >> Regarding the safety question the most important thing in AI is AI trust. >> Yes. So if you are for example delivering a health care service and person on the other side thinks that the person is talking to a doctor AI doctor but doctor is an attack or somewhere in the middle they are stealing personal information then the digital trust go down as a result the AI will not be effective because people will not use it because if you have worried about your personal information getting stolen you'll never going to start an app that delivers the healthcare service to you. So the digital and AI trust is going to be very important but AI is a probabilistic technology. It will hallucinate. So how do you create guard rails and this is what rubric focuses on. So what we are doing is we are helping AI give you deterministic answer by fine-tuning the model by creating guard rail where if it goes beyond what it taught to then we stop the action of agents sometime undo the agent take action essentially making sure that you have trust in your AI system and AI system is also delivering you information that is useful to you even if it is trusted. >> Okay. So yes please go ahead. >> Uh greetings everyone. >> We are combining sir. >> So my question why don't you be seated please? >> Yeah my question is basically that data is the currency for AI. All the LLMs require data. How can we ensure that there's equitable profit sharing to the people who are going to give be giving uh data which is the global south in general. >> Yes please pass on the mic. >> Yes please go ahead. >> Yeah. Uh so I'm Jayam. I'm a final year student from Bits Pilani. So I have a question for Bipol. So like in we have seen one crop of leaders rising to sweetite in big tech then we have seen another crop of US executives starting their own company you are one of the prime examples even and now so like I am entering the workforce now so what advice you have to youngsters like us who are like looking to contribute from India itself to this space so what should we look forward yeah >> okay so people and uh now both of you can take the two questions So a as a young individual who is graduating out of college, you have to first think about how do I create something as opposed to work somewhere and creating something is all about starting a business and it doesn't have to be a global tech business because if you look at 1.4 billion people in India, government job is not going to solve the problem or joining some other MNC is not going to solve the problem. You got to create jobs and you be the job creator. You be the dreamer who goes out there, starts companies, whether it's tech companies, non- tech companies using AI, delivering agricultural services, doing something for your community because you got to be a job creator. Um is a prime example. He has started now his global company from IT Madras incubator. The dream of 2008 is now manifesting it as billions of dollars value company uh now in Silicon Valley. So you got to start somewhere. You got to dream big and you need to take risk not dependent on joining an MNC. >> So perhaps in 2015 I was reading that there was someone who believed in open AI much before we had heard about it. So someone having invested in open AI in 2015 you can imagine the dividends they would be earning now aa the question to the >> yes I think the question was about data >> and sort of um giving credit to the contributors of data who helped to train these models that was the question >> the global south >> the data is coming from the global south >> well I will tell you this um we have a different take on this because we have made a pledge to our customer base including all of our users that we are not going to use your data to train our models uh for our own benefit anyway. We don't train our models period with our customer data. And I think it because of the realization for us that you all are having conversations, you're executing your workflows, you're getting things done on Zoom and we are that trusted partner for you. So we have made I would say we are very different than big tech in this way. We have made that uh drawn that line in the sand that we are not going to do this. And so for example, nobody has had to tell us to do this. No regulator has had to tell us to do this, but we think it's the right thing to do. And I disagree a little bit with Brad Smith in this in the statement of sometimes, yes, you know what's wrong and right in the real world, but you somehow ignore it in the digital world. And you know, this is some this is going to be a place where you are going to have some sort of combination of self-discipline and regulation because in all honesty, um I'm not sure that it's going to work uh simply, but and I think India and with a framework that has been announced has gotten it correct. If you hear the prime minister talk about this, it's innovation light or regulation light and really focusing on innovation and coming up with a framework that makes sense and I think that that is definitely um something that to be very positive about. >> Okay, thank you and I'm going to take the questions but let's welcome S. Krishnan who is the secretary of matei. He is the one who has planned this entire event. So he will know much about regulation, innovation and the road map that India is setting for itself. Uh before he gives the concluding remarks, I'm going to take two more questions. >> Maria, can I ask question? >> Yes, please. One quickly. >> Thank you for uh great uh points made by MKkesh and Aperna. So uh in India now we have a land of creators. Not everyone's going to the top institutions. We still have unicorns being created. But when it comes to AI, it's more about belief. As Maria mentioned 2015, someone saw the spark in OpenAI and it's only because of the dry powder. A open AAI is where it is today. Unfortunately, India, we lack that dry powder. We have innovative startups, we lack funding. Now when institutions like the US India strategic partnership forum, MKkesh, how do you see bridging this gap? We've got a new fantastic ambassador who has come in and there is tremendous talent which is available. How do you bridge the gap on creating? >> I'm going to club one more question that's going to be the last one. Please hand over the mic to him. >> Yeah. So first of all thank you for your talk. Um the first thing I would like to ask sir's thought about what he he said that we are not in LLM race. So what does he think about what is SAM is doing and what other like bhar GPT etc are doing. >> Okay. One one more thing uh I would uh like to ask how those of us who are based outside India or study outside India how can we contribute to whatever uh bridging the gap between uh what Indian eos tech ecosystem is or European tech ecosystem is how can we act as a bridge for this thank you >> you wanted >> how do we ensure that the fragmented initiatives compete with each other avoid it and we can collaborate they can collaborate and be enhance their strength. >> Okay. So, we have had a wide range of questions and also across generations. So, that's the beauty of this audience. Dr. Agi who's asking questions and they are also in would be born in perhaps 2000 or 2002 2004. So, this generation please go ahead. Well, you look at almost I would say 30 years ago or 25 years ago when you had the IITs and IM graduates 80% took jobs with MNC's and they migrated and if you look at today's badge graduating I would say 80% are moving into doing startups or some kind of initiative. So there's a cultural shift which has taken place in the country. Uh risk-taking is accepted. Failure is not shameful anymore. It's okay to fail. And I think more important is is to answer your question on the funding part. Uh we are seeing lot of investment coming in from the US companies. In fact, I was looking at the data almost 90% of the funding at the moment is moving from the US uh uh institutions itself and I think we need to leverage that more and more capital is much more easily available than in India and we look at the address cost and everything. So I think we have to put a special initiative and we'll work we'll work with the startup community. We do have a startup program where Umesh and Bipple were leading that where we were helping uh Indian startup companies to come to the US both from financing, legal and market access perspective. So we're going to expand on that and see how we can support more and more startups. >> Okay. So if you can pass on the mic. So I'll give 30 seconds to all the panelists and the last word will be to the women. So Vipple and Umesh you can go first. Please go ahead. So I last thing I'll say is every inflection creates tremendous new opportunity because there is always some confusion in the marketplace. People are not thinking far ahead. They are just looking at the chaos of the creation and this is the time to take leaprog. That's the moment for India at this time that how do you leverage this new technology to create unique product and services and be the job creator not just the job taker in AI. >> Okay. So I'll uh expand that thread from Bipple on jobs. There's obviously a lot of talk these days about will AI take away jobs and Indian IT services and people saying the death of BO in 5 years etc. At Unifor, we serve, you know, customers, thousands of customers globally. And here's what we get to see. From where we sit, AI is going to lead us to an age of abundance. The earnings of publicly traded companies are about to sharply rise and GDPs of countries that adopt AI at scale are likely to sharply rise. Don't be surprised if you see a sixprint in front of the US GDP closely. And US is a very large economy. India's path to cross 10% growth GDP will be because of AI and that path of abundance will actually create more jobs not less and all of us in this room have an opportunity to benefit and profit from that age of abundance we just have to take the the plunge learn AI apply AI and like Bul said you know take risk and become job creators >> okay 30 seconds quickly You know when I think of India um I think of a country with so many people that are willing to embrace new technology and willing to embrace new things. If you think about it you just have to look at history. You think about it we skipped over in villages in India we have skipped over the tablet and the and the and the the the the computer and gone straight to the iPhone. you when I was visiting family in India 2 years ago I was extraordinarily surprised at how much prevalence even the simple cell phone has in remote corners of this country use that as an example so why should India not embrace AI and those billion billions of people if you make it easy to use if you get rid of a fancy UI and even just use natural language we translate for our AI companion we translate currently into four languages. It should be all of the languages over time. If you can do that and you guys are capable of doing that, if you can do that, why not? So, I would not think of it as a race that's been taken over by two behemoth countries. The world is for you. It's to be taken. >> Yes. So, thank you so much and please be with us. Let me give the closing comments to S. Krishnan. He is the Secretary of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Mr. Krishna Verva and let me begin by congratulating the government of India for organizing this thought summit and for all the efforts that you have put in in ensuring that we get to hear from the best minds from venture capitalists to top uh tech companies and also uh startups and policy makers. So congratulations on behalf of the entire audience. Please sir go ahead. Let me stand so that I can at least see the back of the audience. Uh as I walked in, I was just asked saying was I getting enough sleep and I was just joking with a colleague yesterday that right now if you wake me up I'll I'll talk about AI and something about AI don't have to have a set of [clears throat] but I mean come 21st I'm going to take a sort of a break and say no AI at least for a month or two. On a more serious note, I think uh uh thank you first u for all of you for coming out here for the AI summit. uh a year ago when the prime minister announced in Paris that we would be hosting this uh the way we envisioned it was to actually make it more accessible and available to people because the idea the whole intent of uh AI in India was about democratizing access to AI, access to the resources of AI and making sure it's something that works for people. So just taking away from what uh Mr. Panaba was just saying about you know what is happening in India with regard to AI. The whole idea is that the way that India accesses the digital world is by the mobile phone and many of them are not even going to type what they want. So it has to be voice first and through Bhashini and through many of the other uh uh initiatives that we've led today across 22 Indian languages and across many of the Indian dialects it's possible to just speak into a phone and say I want this a farmer can actually speak into a phone saying I have this uh problem in my field and can you tell me what the solution is or he can consult a doctor and say this is my issue in his own language and the doctor need not even know the language that he's speaking, it'll be translated for him and the doctor can actually prescribe or respond based on what he sees in terms of uh um you know the analysis of an X-ray or analysis of some other diagnostic report. So that is the kind of change that AI potentially can bring to India a voice first uh uh model which sort of works in multiple languages and that's clearly how it needs to work. We are not a one language country. Um content in this country is in multiple languages. So the challenge really is to actually have uh enough data from all of these languages to make sure that we can train our models which is one reason why we need a model of our own and uh having a western model or a model from outside the country doesn't necessarily work. And the second thing is that we are looking to see how AI will work for people. Ultimately it's about inclusion and the kind of things that uh what works when applied to the real world, what works in the agriculture sector, what works for healthcare, what works for education, what works for manufacturing. And many of these need not be very large models. They could be small models. They need not be language models. They can even be quantitative models or vision models and in multiple other ways that they can actually work. And that's precisely the kind of work that is going on right now. Somebody was asking a question about resources and you know the powder. I don't think the powder is so much the issue anymore. I think it is what we have attempted to do is democratize access to the resources or the infrastructure you need for AI which is basically compute uh models and data all three through the AI kosh we have attempted to ensure that people have access to today you can access compute in India for about a third of the price that you can access anywhere else in the world thanks to what we have done through the AI kosh and the models you have access already to 7,500 00 uh data sets. We are pushing that even higher. That's one of the challenges we have to solve often within government where everyone thinks in silos is unwilling to share. We have to break through this uh break through that and we are doing it. We had barely 300 data sets about 6 months ago. We have 7,500 now. We have to grow much faster. And the last set of things that we really need to do is also on um I already spoke about the models but ultimately India is going to be about applications and use cases. That's where the rubber literally hits the road. That's where the jobs get created. That's where actual uh benefit is delivered to people. And that is the space I think Indian companies and others will solve. You may not have coders and programmers but you're going to have domain experts. You're going to have people who develop the applications. You're going to have people who have to actually go and deploy the applications in various organizations in different places not just in India but elsewhere in the world. In some ways, it's probably the Y2K moment all over again. So, I would say that uh our embrace of AI is open-minded. Our embrace of AI is innovation first. Our embrace of AI is enough cause for optimism. We are going to lose far fewer jobs than the developed world is going to if if at all it's such a threat for jobs but the opportunities to actually catch up in the development pathway and the opportunity to actually uh uh become a vixit bharat a developed nation by 2047 is by riding this wave of technology and that is something that India promises to embrace and that's the reason all of you uh have come out here that is the kind of energy we have tried to unleash through the uh event that has been organized. Previous summits have all been rooms where CEOs and uh national leaders and probably a few experts have spoken. The these are rooms where we have invited everybody in. Uh I'm really gratified to see that most of this audience is probably half my age which is which is what we want and which is exactly where we wanted to be and not just here but across in all the halls. This is the kind of energy we wanted to display. Previous exhibits probably had 20 or 30 stalls which kind of showed what was being done. We have 900 plus we have nearly a thousand startups showing you what they have attempted to do. This is energy for you. This is the people who are going to take over. This is engagement for you. These are the people who are going to make AI happen not just for India but for the world. Thank you all coming out here to see what we are up to and see what we are doing here. and thank you for your very eager participation. Minor inconveniences aside, traffic aside, and I apologize for the weather also today, but uh all that apart, I think uh thanks for coming out. It's been great having all of you here and uh hopefully we've extended the expo by one more day and those of you who haven't seen it, do take the chance to see it. Thank you again. [applause] We certainly don't hold you responsible for the bad weather. Okay, so let's have a photo opportunity again and thank you for being a great audience.
