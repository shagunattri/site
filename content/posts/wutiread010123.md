With writing being more and more part of my day, it is important to get those writing muscles in the best shape. Writing a blog or writing in general is a process in itself. First figure out what you want to write and then make it interesting and not divert from the original topic.

The blog covers insights on how to set up a blog and take things slowly building an audience in the process that leads you to refine your writing and be able to choose what works best for you.

Few tips mentioned on why to write on the internet:
- More awesome friendships
- Helps people understand your thought process
- Publish consistently
- Notice and pay attention to feedback

Maintaining momentum with peers in a work-from-home setting is harder than working under the same roof and being able to share ideas and get quick feedback on work. Ben covers how having close co-collaborators at work can help maintain momentum. Other ideas that help maintain momentum are:
- Do projects for people
- Write a lot
- Cold emailing people

To get good work done:
- Have a medium collaboration to deep work ratio
- Do work that is motivating and not tiring
- Be in control of some aspects of decision-making for the work done

Work-life balance often comes up as a topic of discussion with our generation and from my pov, the best way to balance both is to just work on stuff you care about. It shouldn't feel like work(pretty standard textbook advice ngl, but seems to work)

### Product Management Insights from the week

- A Product Roadmap should
  - be fluid
  - be IP
  - show drive and commitment
- In PM, being a generalist with a deep sense of users will go a long way
- You won't enjoy the PM job if you don't enjoy writing - technical, business-backed user-centric content that is understandable to all stakeholders.
