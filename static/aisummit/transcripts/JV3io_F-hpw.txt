on behalf of ISB and ISB Institute of Data Science, I really want to thank uh you know the AI impact summit team and METI for giving us an opportunity to discuss a very interesting topic that is responsible quantum and AI security governing trust res uh risk resilience in the next computing era. We are meeting at a defining technology inflection point. Artificial intelligence is scaling at an unprecedented rate. Around 78% of the organizations globally are using AI in at least one business functions. Global AI market is projected to exceed around 1.8 trillion by 2030. In India around 89% of the enterprises use AI in operations. At the same time with the evolution of technology we have also seen rise in the cyber crimes and at the same time we see quantum computing is moving steadily from research laboratories into strategic deployment conversations with technological giants and like Google, Microsoft, Amazon all working in this particular space. The global quantum computing market is valued at around 1.8 8 billion to 3.5 billion as of 2025. In India, even the Indian government has invested heavily in the national quantum mission and has given a funding of approximately 750 million US dollars. Now, quantum computing holds immense uh promises especially for solving certain problems which AI still is unable to solve. For example, you know the traffic issue which is there. In fact, we all are facing a traffic issue today. So something we hope that quantum computing might be able to resolve in the future. A lot of in drug discovery, it has its application in especially in cancer treatment. So there are multiple advantages of quantum computing even in the financial and the banking sector. But at the same time even this emerging technology that is quantum computing though it exists for many years also comes up with its own risk. That is it is expected that the speed with which the quantum computers are able to process information they are the existing cryptographic algorithms which are keeping a digital system safe are b pr prone to be vulnerable to this and that is the reason most of the governments especially the emerging econom especially the leading economies like the US, UK, uh you know uh Australia, Singapore everybody is working in this particular space in order to keep the digital ecosystem safe. But the question today in front of all of us is not how we are evolving faster or how we can evolve faster but the question is how we can evolve in this emerging adopting this emerging technology and a more responsible way and that is with this we have a very eminent panel uh today in form of Sachin we have uh and Oliver we have Vinayakar on his uh way. I will take this opportunity to introduce a brief about Sachin before we begin. Sachin Kakar is Google India's site lead for privacy, safety and security where he drives the mission to keep everyone safe at scale building solutions that protect billions of people globally. With over 24 years of experience in research and development and engineering leadership, he holds 12 patents in areas such as online content classification, digital media assign uh assessment uh assignment and self-healing system. He's also authored 10 plus international publications. Prior to Google, he served as the India site lead for trust organizations at LinkedIn Microsoft where he led largecale trust platforms, spam protections at scale and global compliance initiatives including GDPR, DMA and CCFA. He holds a master's degree in AI and ML from Georgia Tech and an MBA from IM. A big round of applause for Sachin, please. [applause] Oliver works in the UK government cyber security technical standard team. Uh this is a cross departmental team from across the foreign commonwealth and development office the FCDO uh department of science innovation and technology and the national cyber security center. The team directly engages in global standard development organizations and collaborates with international counterparts, industry partners and technology specialists to help develop key cyber security standards across different technologies including on AI and postquantum cryptography. I request you all to please give a big round of applause for Oliver as well. [applause] This is my question to begin with to both Sachin and Oliver. Uh you know we are at an intersection of AI. AI technology is been rapidly uh you know evolving with AI. Then we have generative AI. Now we talk about agentic AI and then we have quantum uh computing. You know how important do you think quantum computing is for today's and how do you think the uh you know intersection of AI and quantum will happen? Yeah, thanks Ruthie for having me and uh really excited to see how this panel unfolds. So talking about how quantum and AI are coming together. I think each one of them has a path to come along and each one will do its best and I'll unpack it later but overall I believe that they are going to feed into each other and create a flywheel effect. So let's start with AI. All of you know that AI needs lot of highquality data to actually succeed and quantum is able to simulate lot of complex physical systems. So if you talk about battery chemicals in order to simulate that complex system you need quantum processors to do it more accurately. So once you have that model simulated you can feed it into the AI models and then AI can convert it into energy optimizations. So that's one part of the story where quantum is helping AI to get the data. The complimentary loop where AI is now actually helping engineers to actually design quantum hardware and stabilize that. For example, optimizing the system control AI is actually helping quantum engineers. So now on one side quantum is getting expanded because of AI support. Then quantum is used to model physical systems which is feeding back into AI. So therefore it's creating a very interesting feedback loop and that's why we believe that both of them together will create a lot of synergy. >> So I come from a cyber security background. So, I'm often the person in the room who's always the doom and gloom saying, you know, all these systems are terrible and they're gonna inherently have lots of problems and they're going to cause problems in the world. And I'm going to only partially do that. [laughter] Um so it should be said that both AI systems you know AI ML uh Gen AI um AGI um and also quantum technologies quantum computers we should be promoting them. It's great that we have a summit uh talking about this technology uh talking about how we can make opportunities out of it. Um and um because actually it will you know it will for the most part improve people's lives. There are opportunities there. It is good economically, financially for people, for businesses, for countries. So I think that is good that we are able to um promote that kind of uh technology going on. However, this is where I go into my doom and gloom slightly. There are still cyber security uh issues problems on both technologies on both AI and on uh quantum. So with AI there are inherently there are ways to uh uh there are vulnerabilities within AI systems themselves that need to be addressed. Um there is you know there's uh data poisoning, there's prompt injection uh attacks, there's a whole range of different attacks that can be used to um to take advantage of various different specific vulnerabilities within AI systems that need to be addressed. And so the world needs to actually kind of come together and address those particular cyber risks. for quantum as well. There are a number of uh issues when it comes to uh cryptographically relevant quantum computers which um and I'll I'll probably end up talking about it later on, but it essentially will um uh uh uh highlight vulnerabilities in existing uh cryptography uh and will therefore kind of risk our own existing data at the at this um at the moment. Um, and it should be said AI tools may help with some cryptographic discovery activities as preparations go for postquantum cryptography. Um, and AI supported uh vulnerability research may help the development of robust implementations of of PQC but I'll probably end up talking a little bit more about PQC later on. Thank you. >> Thanks Oliver. U Sin as Oliver mentioned about you know the cryptographic risk that will arise from quantum computing. We all are aware that you know the technological platforms basically operate at a very massive computational uh scales and there is where again we already have cyber risk coming in but with uh if quantum implementation the cyber risk will be at more rise we also see a lot of uh increase uh you know in uh data breaches uh these uh days. So where do you see a realistic you know convergence in terms of you know how PQC could be integrated you know or quantum computing in AI in model training or cryptographic optimization or simulations in the existing uh you know technological platforms. >> Got it. Yeah. Thanks. I I first of all I agree I think in the postquantum world the current encryption will not work and that's a real concern that we face. So a lot of people when we talk about migration into the new world, they think of it as flipping a big switch. So you move from one world to the new world. But at Google, our our thinking is it's more like reinforcing a building like this one where people are still sitting inside it. What I mean is creating a hybrid layered encryption where you already have a classic encryption of today followed by the post quantum resistant techniques on as a safety net. So I think the real challenge that we are think seeing is u attackers are taking the current data encrypted data and storing it for later when once the quantum processors are there they will be able to decrypt it. So this is the real concern where the long live data data which needs to be secret for long run is actually being harvested by attackers so that in future they can decrypt. Now the way to manage it is to actually create multi-layered system along with the current system. Number one. Number two, the other challenge we are seeing as engineering in the postquantum cryptography algorithms the the the length of the keys are much longer than the current keys. So if the systems are not able to handle the long keys and they are optimized for current encryption keys they will not be able to handle the throughput they have to face. So these systems have to be upgraded to be able to handle the longer keys otherwise they will slow down. So that's the second challenge we are seeing and we need to work on it as a as an industry. And finally there's a NIST National Institute of Technology and Standards. Uh this is the one which is guiding us to build the foundational deployment as we converge both crypto and AI. And what is important is the focus is on the software not on the hardware. Can we change the software keeping the existing hardware? So like you asked for how to scale it. You cannot scale it by moving into a new hardware because all existing hardware needs to be protected. So what we recommend at Google is to use libraries. Uh for example, there's a tink library. Uh it's an open- source library which provides the current encryption algorithm. It can upgrade itself behind the scene and you don't have to change any existing system. So if the software upgrades [snorts] without impacting the underlying system, without rewriting the tech stack, without changing the new hardware, I think that will be the best path forward uh to scale into the new world. >> Thanks uh Sachin. Uh so Oliver as you know Sachin also mentioned the implementation which is there uh you know requires certain uh because organizations or you know the governments of different will also have to you know first make a inventory of where you know cryptography is currently being used where all decryption and what are the existing algorithms of you know we have Raa ma'am here a big round of applause for her please >> uh so you know coming my question to you is you know we know that UK already has a particular plan they has come up with certain guidelines of migration especially the timelines where they say by 2030 you know they want all the governments and the uh and the industry to migrate to uh PQC. uh you know so from a national cyber defense uh perspective if you can uh you know add more on how UK is basically planning a quantum enabled cryptographic avoiding the quantum enabled cryptographic disruption and though I mentioned 2030 what timelines are actually shaping these transition strategies and how is the quantum risk being integrated in the national threat uh modeling and also uh is there any change in the new cyber security policies uh you know considering the risk that will be coming from quantum computing. >> Yeah, it's a really good question because this is a this is taking up a lot of time across UK governments but also across industries and uh and across many governments across the world. And so that's why we're really keen to kind of get this message out as well. So just I guess I I I I don't know whether everyone in the audience is is aware of everything. I'm not sure what the baseline knowledge is here. So I guess you know we've already kind of talked about it a couple of times but just for those that are less familiar with the topic a quantum enabled cryptographic destruction essentially means when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer and there are lots of different quantum computers out there being being developed and made. So we're only in this particular case we're only talking about cryptographically relevant quantum computers. When that is eventually developed, it will have the capability to break or solve existing cryptographic algorithms um that would allow an attacker to unencrypt data within seconds um and then have access to that information. So the primary mitigation to this particular risk is to migrate IT systems and OT operational technology systems which we've already we've already talked about and that is called postquantum cryptography or PQC. We simply do not know when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will be developed. In the UK, we have the national quantum um yeah national quantum computing center which acts as a test bed for the evolving uh quantum computing technologies. So we use this to get insights into quantum computing development but every country is at you know maybe slightly different stages and some countries are slightly more kind of uh secretive in terms of how far they are or how far they not are potentially. So for the UK, I can't speak for every country obviously, but for the UK, we have set three key milestones that we expect government, UK government departments and critical sectors within our economy to work to. So by 2028 um companies or uh government departments need to define their migration goals. They also need to carry out a full discovery exercise. So that's assessing your estate to to understand which services and infrastructure that depend on cryptography um that need to be upgraded at PQC. It sounds like you're doing you're already doing that. You're which is good. Um and build an initial plan for migration by 2031. Um we expect uh uh companies to carry out early highest priority PQC migration activities um and refine the plan so that they have a thorough roadmap for completing uh migration and then by 2035 complete migration to PQC of all the systems and services and products that they have and so our milestones because I said we can't predict when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will be developed our milestones are actually based on uh the timelines what we expect for international standards to evolve and um we've already had kind of we've talked about NIST already but how we expect the PQC ecosystem to grow to support it and how much time it will take most organizations to prepare and plan properly. So you know the most important thing right now is for organizations to identify where they carry risk. So this kind of discovery exercise for well planned and well orchestrated PQC migration is essential to avoid increasingly more generic cyber risks. Um and then I don't I don't necessarily have much to say on the sort of national threat modeling part of the question but in but in terms of the UK government we have identified clear roles and responsibilities uh across relevant government teams to work with companies in the critical sectors of our economy to understand the threat itself their own individual respons uh their own individual vulnerabilities and to help them mitigate their individual risks through the migration process. >> Thank you Oliver. Uh Ram is here. I'll just give a brief about introduction of Ram. She's currently serving as a senior consultant with NITIO and prior to that she has led the emerging technologies wing of the information technology and electronics communication department government of uh Telangana. She has been in fact responsible for implementing several innovative projects that use emerging technologies such as medicine for sky which delivers vaccines you know then blockchain for traceability of seeds and food pro uh products deployed an AI pest management uh tool that has helped farmers to prevent significant damage across crops. Ma'am you have been working extensively in the field where AI or technology can be used for the benefit of the society. Now as AI scales and quantum technology matures and we see the risk that is coming from you know quant quantum computing with both Sachin and Oliver mentioning how should uh India position quantum computing within its broader national innovation strategy considering the risk that is arising from quantum especially for the digital public infrastructure healthcare and the governance uh systems. Uh your thoughts on this please. Yeah, apologies for coming in late. I was stuck in the traffic. I followed Google map very you know somehow estimated the time everything but Google also couldn't you know forecast the traffic and I think because of the rain we were just going round and round and round finally reached. So yeah uh uh so actually before I talk about the race I just want to say something like you know uh uh see AI actually has sort of you know uh being adopted in India elsewhere but quantum is something that is while it's still in the nent stage as a country we really want to you know um be ahead of the curve in this particular technology so we are not looking at just you you know coming out with some quantum labs or something but we want to make India you know as a quantum ready nation so with that vision you know we actually uh recently three months back I think NITA released a national strategy report on quantum prior to that of course you may be knowing uh you know DST has actually uh set up the quantum national quantum machine with an outlay of 6,500 so in it's essentially fundamental research but what our report NITI's report focuses fus on is how do we actually you know execute this whole vision that we are looking at and make the country as quantum ready. So in fact a lot of other things that we have indicated in the report the five key sectors that India would like to focus on I just because we're talking about healthcare. So what what would it be like you know a quantum nation means for us. So while five sectors we have identified starting from you know defense strategic area is one defense aerospace where we can use uh quantum communications uh quantum sensing and we want to actually you know come out with the uh navigation system that's currently there. So uh strategic area defense is one. Second second uh is logistics. This is another important area. You might be aware of the gatishaki project that the government of India has implemented. So using quantum optimization you know to solve problems at the last mile delivery is what we are looking at using quantum. The other is quantum peripherals. Then fourth one is quantum finan banking and financial. That's one of the strong uh industry here. We have a robust banking system in India compared to any other country. So again you know using comp uh quantum computing for fraud detection uh risk analysis and so on and the last one that's close to our heart is you know pharma and healthcare that's one of the areas that we are currently focusing on in fact we are partnering with triple IT Hyderabad you know uh to work actually to come out with a road map for 10 years as to how to make India a quantum enabled nation in the healthcare that's what we are looking at uh So and why is that healthcare is so important to us? Just imagine this is our vision you know it looks fantasy right now but we want to really you know arrive there. So what is it like a uh poor student you know patient a child patient somewhere in a remote village in Rajasthan uh is suffering from a rare genetic disease right now to with the current technologies it's really difficult to diagnose this gene related diseases but with quantum simulations you know molecule simulation you can actually uh identifi I mean drug discovery can be accelerated one so we can actually you know come out with personalized medicine or prec precision medicine is what we are looking at uh which will I mean we believe that quantum simulation and sensing will actually accentuate or accelerate that drug discovery and uh pre precision medicine. So this particular rural you know child will get will get that you know precision medicine from a health DPI is what we are looking at it this is a vision at 2035 is a 10 year road map I said right it is delivered again not from an urban hospital but from the rural primary healthcare center through a digital hospital so this is how we intend to use quantum to make it you know yeah I'll actually come to the risk later this is our vision you know I mean focus on the prior sectors and then leverage this technology to solve problems specific for India. >> Yeah, that's very well articulated B because that's the deed of the R uh you know where quantum computing can solve problems which have currently not been able to uh address which is there so to >> classical computing you know algorithms. >> Can I add some something on that? I think just to reinforce Rama's point, I think one way to think about quantum processor, it's a highly accurate, super powerful scientific calculator which can simulate a lot of complex things. So when Google launched late 2024, the Vevel chip, it was able to simulate or able to handle a complex problem in under five minutes which can actually take 10 to 25 uh manual years. So they call it septalian years. So imagine that kind of current supercomputers will take 10 to about 25 years and that below chip was able to solve in less than 5 minutes just one application but it shows how much you can do in such a small amount of time and drug discovery is such a complex problem and I think lot can be done using these super like super powerful calculators. >> I hope Google can also partner in that. >> Oh absolutely. Also I just add uh you know even in cancer treatment especially the radiotherapy also in fact you know quantum computing there's a bit of work that's happening and in fact uh the folks wagon cars have also I think partnered with Google sjin please correct me in terms of uh you know able to identify a correct route or a shortest path or an optimal path in traffic this work is still in process is happening but you know the industry also understands the need of having a quantum uh computing to address issues and problems which are currently not been able to uh addressed. So even in the banking uh sector uh you know we have uh there are multiple uh areas especially in back banking also where quantum computing can solve you know interesting problem uh statements. We have Vinax sir here. A big round of applause for uh him. Thank you Vinayak sir uh for joining uh in which is there uh there is a group photograph which the organizing team has been uh requesting. I'll request all the speakers uh you know we before I go for the next uh question we can just have a group photograph. Uh thank you everyone. So we in fact you know 205 basically worked with the BFSI uh sector. We had around 180 banks and financial institutions participating in our project and uh in terms of you know they know that quantum computing is a need of the R. It is important for the BFSI sector but 75 70% of the BFSI sector CESOS and the CTOs mentioned that they have you know very little or low or moderate knowledge of quantum computing and 57.5% of them have said that in the next 3 years they know their anticipated timeline for quantum computing to to migration and it also might you know get in new risk. 87.5% of them said that they are cons also concerned apart from the advantages of quantum computing about the cyber threats arising from quantum computing and their preparedness to deal with these cyber attacks is as low as one on a scale of 1 is to uh five which is there such we know that you know quantum computing is going to be a a risk which is there but uh you know from and we know that even migration may not be that easy even we say that you know we want to migrate to PQ uh C. So what does postquantum migration actually uh looks like? You think it will be complex for global platforms? How can organizations because this is the issue that everybody's going to face right from the government to the industry the uh you know the small industries which are there. How can organizations actually in today's world protect the longive data they have from the future attacks of uh quantum? >> Sure. I think this this is a real concern that postquantum processors can actually decrypt the current encrypted data. So I think there there are four phases that I can think of. Start with the inventory of the data that needs to be protected. This is the data which is very sensitive uh needs to be kept secret for long term. Uh so uh which means they call it long live data. So if as a as an organization understand what part of that data needs to be protected number one. Number two as I earlier said create another layer of protection. Uh don't move to the new protection but say current cryptography alongside the new postquantum resilient techniques or algorithms. So that's the adding a safety net second layer of that. Third NIST is providing the foundational way of deployment of that software. So uh get get the understanding of those standards on how to deploy. Fourth, use libraries and plugins rather than rewrite the entire text stack. The moment you use libraries, they can upgrade from one encryption algo to the another encryption algo without touching the rest of the text stack. So that way security takes years not months to upgrade. uh you can continue to run your application while those libraries are actually upgrading themselves. And finally, once you have done that, the final thing is rolling out at scale. And that's an important part that how you can make sure that the entire software security component is replaced without changing the hardware uh without uh moving or rewriting your text stack. While you do that, remember I said the longer uh keys that are needed. So therefore keep an eye on your network network bandwidth your throughput and performance the non-functional requirements to make sure your underlying system does not slow down when you move to the PQC or migrate to the PQC world. >> Thanks uh Sachin uh Vak sir uh like you know uh you know that we have been working in this particular space we see that you know all the technological firms are working very actively in this particular uh space which is uh there. Ma'am also mentioned uh about uh you know the advantages and the mission which India has on and how they can we can effectively use quantum computing but we also see the other side of it which is the risk that might uh coming in. Now in the past one year be after we launched our particular report in 2025 ISB has been very actively working with the BFSI sector you know uh trying to you know make them aware of what is quantum computing that's one thing and the different risk that might arise and how they should migrate to PQC or they should make their systems resilient to cyber attacks that would arise from quantum computing let me phrase it that way now DACI also you know very actively works in this particular uh space in your experience how do you think is the industry or the government because the data of risk is both for the government as well as the industry. How do you see the government and the industries's uh you know perspective about uh quantum because why I'm saying is the BFSI sector we see okay RBI guidelines so they're still waiting for that you know so I just want to know from you how you are seeing how the industry and the government is looking at this >> yeah thank you and I'm sorry for my late arrival here uh owing to traffic u so the until now I think there was no national guidelines for this migration. Uh DST published that last week. I was chairing subcommittee of uh DST which is quantum safe migration and this draft which was published and tomorrow is the date for uh inputs that people can give it to the D and after that guidelines published. So this guidelines has two thing basically one is once the guidelines produce this guidelines is applicable to all the sectors basically right and there are distinction the guidelines talks about is there a general sectors and critical sector basically and the timelines milestone has been defined for that three milestone has been defined for that right and once it is there I think most of regulators now would be relying their obligations mandate based on those guidelines and that will really accelerate the journey towards um uh uh PQC implementation or QD we are saying quantum resolency technology choice is your choice not a PQC or QD or both of them basically right so we we see now because of this I had seen last two days couple of banking industry has put up a policy for quantum residency basically right mean because they are members so we understand that so suddenly there is acceleration just by draft guidelines there's acceleration uh coming in this way right and then when we see this so we We are also seeing and we are working with NQM being part of that. So understanding how this means for different sectors. So for example uh banking center is a difficult to implement but uh very complex to implement but but the impact wise if you look at the capital sector is much better bigger problem to look at where you can implement it easily but capital sector has this synchronization as a very important part of this basically and the synchronization requires them to look at the all the latency performance and all this much better basically right so every sector has an implications basically so government is trying to understand what that implications in different sectors is we are even trying to think about and we already put together something and with the guidance of ENQM as well kind of observatory uh where how we see different sectors progressing towards this milestone we define as a part of resilency plan basically right so this observatory is guiding will be guiding basically what what we see in banking sector capital sector power sector telecom sector for that matter where they prepared and where exactly the challenges basically right and while we this there's also effort of how exactly technology ecosystem is evolving to comply with this lot of technology companies now committing timeline this quarter next quarter some of them saying 26 by end of 26 27 so also getting watch on this technology ecosystem is very important and what I think such talked about agility is very important uh in this entire ecosystem the way you implement it and way you are uh evolving your so agility is very important basically so agile way of imple implementation is very important. That's another important area that we are also focusing. >> Oliver, would you like to add to that? How have what is the pattern that you all have seen in the UK? Uh you know in terms of the implementation of uh PQC. >> So we've got some really good relationships with some uh very large companies across different uh critical sectors. Um and we're working with big companies. Obviously Google is going to be one of those particular companies. Um uh so the message is getting out there definitely the some of the problems that we're facing is that we're not getting messages back from the industry themselves. We really um we need to have that transparency from both uh companies but also our international partners as well actually as to what what successes are they having, what challenges are they having, what problems are they having when when starting to form these migration plans. And we're getting that from some organizations, but we're it's it's not quite as transparent as we would like. um in part because it's useful for us to reflect on and try to improve that that guidance um but then also making sure that then we can then provide that advice back to them and then work with other companies in case they are also facing similar problems. So I would say the message is out there. Some good work is going on by some companies, but I think some other companies are maybe putting their head in the sands or just not not quite engaged as we would like them to be, which is why panels like this is really useful to get that message out there to to keep on banging that drum. >> Thanks Oliver. Uh so uh Ramadan we have seen that you know responsible AI framework has evolved reactively like AI technology has been there then you know with the IoT coming in we realized okay there's a lot of data that is getting generated and then AI algorithms has been used to process that particular uh data we also see that you know a lot of data is getting generated but when in terms of data protection we saw certain challenges coming in and then we had the AI frame responsible AI framework so we can say that it is more like a reactive uh thing which is there. Now in terms of quantum like as you mentioned we already have a you know vision for the next 10 years in India. So how can India proactively design or anything in that mission about you know designing a responsible quantum governance uh framework from the not just the Indian perspective but you think can be extended even for South Asia or uh you know >> yeah uh shri that's a very good question that you asked in fact you know you're right with AI it was kind of a reactive thing you know and AI almost matured I would say and then we started understanding its problems misinformation information, disinformation, fakes, defects and came out with uh now I mean still India we did not come out with regulation as such but of course Europe, US, US also did not come out but US Europe has come out with the regul regulatory framework as such. So but with uh quantum I think you know once quantum may choose we may not have that kind of window also that we have had for AI it'll be so you know quickly. So in our road map that's what we have indicated what we said was as um you know G was also mentioning I'm glad that guidelines have already been come out with PQC you know and it's no more you know hypothetical situation all of us are aware that tomorrow you know when quantum computing comes in you know it's going to uh you may correct me if I'm wrong so break the existing cryptography so that's what we we want to actually mandate you know I mean what the government can can do is uh can we actually launch national PQC test beds so that uh organizations or critical infrastructures you know they can actually use these test beds and you know implement the PQC. The second one is uh government need to mandate you know the public sector institutions that have critical infrastructure to become quantum ready. So these are uh I would say proactive steps not reactive I mean well in advance not you know once something happens it's not should be reactive and also start migrating critical infrastructure early like water supply systems rates and so on you know that's another one that we're looking at and uh that's what another thing that we mentioned in the report was uh India need to come out with its own benchmarks and standards and it has always been you know already this might have already come out with certain standards but it's always like follow the standards at least in the quantum area can we come out with Indian specific standards so participate in the global standards you know organizations as such so uh that's a proactive thing that we need to look at you know from the Indian side then um while just like AI even uh you know quantum can also accentuate the digital divide you know not just between nations but even society so uh what is that uh the government should do proactively or India as a nation should do you know So uh so how can we actually democratize access through you know like India machine is making available compute you know to startups, researchers, academic institutions and governments. So can we also plan similar uh thing for quantum? Can we make available quantum infrastructure you know uh to different uh organizations startups students and so on and we need to actually take up national skilling programs while these things one critical area probably V can answer that uh I mean again I'm not too technical person but if quantum memory is going to extend the data life you know life time then we the current data frameworks will not work so what are those future frameworks works that we need to work on data framework as you rightly mentioned you know those kind of frameworks we need to bring in so probably can comment on that >> sir can you please uh >> yeah so uh ma'am talked about so many thing and one of the important area is definitely use of quantum by different set of businesses is a very big challenge right and access to quantum resources is very computing resources is very important right I know there's a cost significant cost 2,000 to $7 to $8,000 per month cost that you need to incur and there is a also a kind of a uh waiting list for you. So one is what we are building as our own quantum computer but there is also mighty recently uh thought about an idea to have this powerful quantum computer in India while we are building our own thing. So I think by September October we'll have one of the significant powerful quantum computer built in sedak facility which will be available to researchers one hand another to the industry as well but uh my my biggest worry is real value chain come from the algorithms and softwares. So while hardware it looks like lot of things have didn't progress aggressively at a pace in a global platform but software algorithm is our foray right and if that itself we are lagging that's a challenge in fact uh we are working with government and industry as well and with especially the user industry if you look at HSBC groups they talk about the what they doing with quantum computer but we don't see happening that from Indian bank or Most of them they worried about security problem but not like how to use quantum for some of the solving business problems or creating new possibilities for them. So we're creating a effort we I working with RBI, SIB and many of those kind of regulators as well. How do we push the Indian ecosystem otherwise we are we have quantum mission but we need to create a market for those kind of capabilities as well. So that's the effort we have been putting from data concept India perspective. >> Thank you. Uh we just have a few minutes more to go and a very uh you know the session has evolved very nicely from you know quantum the risk uh you know the Indian quantum mission. Sir also added you know the advantages how uh of quantum how effectively the businesses should start implementing and testing uh the advantages of quantum and how can be integrated in the business uh model uh which is there. So uh this is my question to all of you all uh which is you know as we know that quantum capability advances globally. Okay. Do we think there is a need uh you know for having international collaborations coordination uh you know because we know the advantages of it. We also know the risk in terms of advantages having business uh solutions. How do you see uh international collaboration between governments, industries uh you know that will help uh progress not just India but globally? How do you see that? Uh you know I can Vachin would you like to comment on that? >> Well I think the answer is completely yes. We are all in this together. Uh I think as a country as academia uh as as industry government I think all of us are here. I think the way industry can help is sometimes we are in the forefront of pushing the frontiers and experimenting. For example, at Google, our internal coms are already post uh postquantum resilient algorithms. So, we are already protecting our data. So, we we have experiment some numbers along with us. Uh we have internal frameworks. AI is not new to us. We have been experimenting with AI for decades. Uh remember Alpha Fold got launched like 8 10 years back. We were the first one to launch the transformer paper. So when we were building those AIs, we were also building security around that and thankfully industry had lot of resources and people to build those security framework and Google has been very benevolent in sharing those frameworks openly free of cost. So go/secure AI framework is already outside. So we keep sharing those framework outside uh publishing our papers. We are actively working with NISTD and we are co-sponsor co-authored one of the crypto encryption algorithm which is now I think in the top two in the competition. I think the goal is to keep sharing with the world so that rest of the country academia they can adopt and we can be the partners uh with academia to make sure we provide the right set of environment resources so that we can experiment together publish the latest research together. Oliver uh how do you see India UK collaborating in this particular space? >> Yeah, imagine if I came out and said no we shouldn't collaborate. No clearly the best method is to collaborate both UK and India but also every country as you said we are in this together. It's a global opportunity and risk um uh for both the public sector and the private sector. I guess in terms of my own bread and butter, the work that I tend to specialize on in international standards, I think there should be more alignment and engagement from across different uh countries and companies on standards. You know, we talked about the NIST standards, but from the from the UK side, the UK National Cyber Security Center has participated in a a number of standards bodies um for for for for quite a few years and IETF, the Institute for Engineering Task Force and Internet Engineering Task Force, something along those lines. the ITF is um it it has been working on protocol standards to support the NIS standards and EPS which is which stands for the European telecommunications standards institute which is a global standards body it's not just Europe based it is a global standards body that's been working on um standards for the implementation of all of this um and so kind of contributions from cyber security and cryptographic expertise from across the globe in private sector and the public sector would be incredibly valuable in those standards bodies and uh looking at the work that's going on on on the standard side. Um as that is that makes the internet it makes uh global citizens and organizations who use it more secure. Uh migration to PQC is a global scale and multi-year challenge underpinned by the kind of you know standards for algorithms, protocols and systems. So that is exactly why we need to be kind of working together. So we would from a from a UK government perspective, we would very much encourage others who are interested in this work both from government and private sector uh to to to be involved with those relevant bodies uh to contribute to the security of those kind of emerging technology standards. Um and it like you know it should be said that there are some differences in the details of the approach to deploying PQC across different nations and that is fine that doesn't matter so much because as long as you are um uh working in a standards compliant way then that's all that is really required at that stage and then you can kind of do your own kind of national um level of implementation based on your kind of your own market conditions. Um so so yeah >> uh Raman your views on this? Yeah, I mean frontier technologies always you know both them uh collaboration partnerships are the key in any technology area if you look at both national and global partnerships you know so if you look at the Andhra Pradesh Quantum Valley Corporation that they have set up this is in partnership with industry IBM then NTCS uh and I think L&T you know so uh I mean government alone will not be able to you know come out with e or work on solutions or infrastructure or uh you know uh in any tech technological area. So in fact Oliver covered everything I think and Sachin both together he covered standards and Sachin covered you know broader areas of partnership what we can get from each other like uh industry then research organizations also are the key impact NQM invest is invest I mean whatever funding that it's giving to the research organizations I mean they're going to come out with products you know quantum products so another area that we can look at or we should look at you know in in terms of global parters partnership is now we are having a couple of startups that are you know upcoming in quantum so how do we actually give them market access globally that's one area of partnership that we need to really work on how do we create demand as u you know like we said you know while they're developing where is the demand for that within India and outside so that's what access to market access to funding probably we need to set up a national quantum accelerator in partnership with you know all the stakeholders Yes. So, how do you see international collaboration? You know like we have COD where India was each of them talked about the areas but we work with NITO national security uh implication of quantum technology and our worry is um once they start reaching to that level it will probably inv secrecy because a lot of geopolitics is associated with quantum technology right so nations needs to work together from the national security perspective because there's a profound advantage antage that a country would have if they have this capability early in the game basically right and I think from the national security perspective or overall global security perspective uh that discussion needs to be carried out because we will not know if any country especially adversal country has this powerful quantum computer in place or not basically how we create a transparency in that area and how do you cooperate in such a way that This is a technology which is not used for any destructive purposes. I think that is very important agenda for >> yeah just to add probably we need to have a global framework you know for on the use of >> global responsible quantum application framework yeah very rightly said we have almost done and times up just want to thank all these speakers for a wonderful uh discussion you know in the space of quantum computing and how responsibly quantum can be adopted not just by India or UK but globally you know what can be done we know that technology will keep uh emerging. We have learned from history that it's very important that we adopt technology in a very responsible uh way. The real leadership challenge before us is not just quantum supremacy but you know having quantum applications more responsibly. So thank you everyone and we really want to thank the organizers you know for giving us this particular opportunity to discuss on this very interesting uh topic. >> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Uh we have a small token of appreciation. Uh this is on behalf of the AI impact uh summit uh team. We also have a smallation from Good evening everyone. Thank you for attending this session. So thank you everyone. So I would like to thank all the speakers of this particular session.
