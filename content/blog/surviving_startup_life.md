Welcome to the startup life.

Let me ask you something - have you ever been in a meeting where every word you say feels like it’s under a microscope? Where the air feels thinner (metaphorically, but also literally if your nerves are shot), and you’re just trying to breathe while making your point?

Yeah, welcome to startup life.

It’s fast. It’s relentless. And sometimes, it feels like you’re climbing Everest with no oxygen tank. But here’s the thing—if you’re smart, prepared, and self-aware, you can thrive. This post isn’t just advice; it’s a field guide based on my experiences—both wins and stumbles—in the competitive and dynamic world of startups.

### Startup Culture: Everything’s a Priority

Picture this: you’re at the centre of a storm. Tasks flying at you. Deadlines looming. And someone’s always yelling “ASAP!” Here, everything is a priority. Your job? Figure out what actually matters and execute it like yesterday.

But here’s the rub: startup life isn’t just about being fast; it’s about being deliberate. You can’t afford to move quickly in the wrong direction. I’ve learned this the hard way—chasing every shiny object doesn’t work. Instead, I’ve started asking myself, What truly moves the needle for the business? That’s where your energy should go.

### Corporate Speak: Speaking to Be Heard (and Understood)

Here’s a pro tip I wish someone had told me earlier: when you’re in a meeting with leadership, time is the rarest currency.

Executives don’t have time for fluff. They don’t care about your process (at least not initially). They care about outcomes. What’s the solution? What’s the result? Why does it matter?

Think of these meetings as climbing a mountain. The higher up you go, the thinner the air (or, in this case, patience). You need to deliver your message quickly and clearly. For me, it’s been a journey to master this. I used to ramble, explaining every little detail of how I got to a solution. Now? I lead with the answer, then explain the “how” only if asked.

And trust me, nothing feels better than nailing that clarity.

### The Subtle Art of Reading the Room

Corporate life—and especially startups—are full of politics, whether you like it or not. In group settings, every word you say can echo longer than you think. Early on, I learned a hard truth: **not everything needs to be said, and not everything needs to be said by you.**

Before speaking up, I now ask myself:

- Does this need to be said right now?

- Does it add real value?

- Am I prepared to defend it?

It’s not about being timid; it’s about being strategic. In startups, every misstep feels magnified, and while people may not call you out directly, you’ll see it reflected in feedback and appraisals later. So, think twice, and when you speak, make it count.

### Beyond Work: Building the Best Version of You

Startup life can feel all-consuming, but here’s the thing: if you don’t make time for yourself, no one else will.

Recently, I’ve been focusing on my health, which has been a game-changer. But it’s not enough to just check the “work” and “health” boxes. 

There’s more to life than tasks and treadmill miles. I’ve started to explore what excites me beyond the grind - meeting new people, diving into hobbies, and thinking about where I want to be in the long term.

Here’s what I’ve learned: a well-rounded life makes you sharper at work. You’ll communicate better, handle stress like a pro, and build relationships that actually matter.

### Key Takeaways from the Trenches

If there’s one thing I want you to walk away with, it’s this: **you’re in control.** Startup life may feel chaotic, but with the right mindset and strategies, you can not just survive but thrive.

- **Speed is key, but precision wins the race.** Move fast, but always ask, “Is this the right direction?”

- **Master the art of brevity.** Speak clearly, get to the point, and save the fluff for after-work drinks.

- **Play the game smartly.** Read the room, know when to speak, and always be prepared to back it up.

- **Invest in yourself.** Work is important, but so is your health, your relationships, and your personal growth.

So, whether you’re climbing the corporate ladder or just trying to keep your footing in a fast-moving startup, remember: it’s not just about surviving the climb. It’s about enjoying the view from the top.
