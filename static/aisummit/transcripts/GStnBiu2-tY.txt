Everyone before we start I have a announcement to make. Um this is to inform you that all the sessions today will conclude by 4:20 p.m. All participants are required to exit the Bharat bandapam venue premises by 4:30 p.m. and sessions teams will uh will must ensure timely closure in accordance with security protocols. The expo would be open till 8:00 p.m. You could visit the expo as well. Kindly ensure you adhere to the instructions to leave the session halls by 4:30 p.m. to avoid inconvenience to all concerned. With that, I would uh like the start today's panel is on balancing sovereignty and and collaboration AI frameworks for nations. We have an all-star cast uh featuring Shin Pakurka from Nvidia, Tulion from COP 30, uh Daniel Abadi from CDPI, so Shivas GI from Miy and we have Rahul Matan from Triille. Um I think you're going to have a great time. I'll let Rahul take the floor. >> Thanks. Thank thanks Mahir. Um so look this is a this is an interesting uh conversation uh to have particularly at this uh fairly interesting uh time in the geopolitical uh history of the world. I think we'll all agree that there's really no need for every country in the world to build a semiconductor industry uh to build uh uh you know the entire AI stack. But at this particular point in time there is this feeling that we must all as nations uh be self-reliant uh be self uh self-dependent be independent and be resilient and so I think in that context it's really important to have this particular conversation because you know it unlike um uh you know widgets uh it's actually not possible to be full stack AI from top to bottom other than if you are a very large country uh with a uh uh uh you know with a with a I guess there's probably China and India that qualify as countries that potentially have the ability to do uh full stack AI and there are a large number of countries in the world that also need um need to think about this uh in in that context. So that's one lens that I think we're going to we're going to talk about which is um there is on the one hand the sovereignity angle and then there is on the other hand the real important part of collaboration and then since we're talking about AI framework for nations we're also going to take a planetary look at uh the problem uh and uh we're going to try and understand this from the perspective of some of the most complex problems that uh the world and the globe is is facing right now. and how that sort of global nature of that problem uh can force us to think uh in uh in a in sort of a new way. So for so with uh with that brief introduction scene setting uh as it were I'm going to turn uh to to Schulpa and I'm going to say you know Shilpa uh in in many ways the root of all of this the base of this entire stack is silicon and you know as far as you are concerned you make the silicon and you are fairly agnostic. I mean if someone uh if a big AI lab gives you a lot of money uh you will give them the silicon they need. If a nation gives you a lot of money you'll give them the silicon they need. I don't make want to make you sound like a mercenary but I mean at the end of the day uh you are essentially building the silicon that this whole AI revolution needs. But I want you to answer the question in the context of um you know this there are these large frontier models that are doing amazing things that quite frankly are being diffused to the whole world. But you balance that with the need for sovereign nations uh to have some resilience. And as someone who is building in a sense the engine that powers this um what is what is one your strategic uh direction as a company and what is your strategic advice uh to the nations of the world as to how to how to package this and think about this? >> Yeah, great question. Thank you so much uh for that and uh very excited to be here first of all. Thank you for having us um here. Um so what I'd like to say is um sovereignty um is yes it is about building uh every nation having self-reliance um the uh independence in terms of being able to operate uh the AI um in case of any kinds of geopolitical issues and whatnot. Um but it is also about interdependence. Increasingly uh you know AI is is definitely the future of AI is global. Um but it's going to be deeply local as well. And as you stated earlier in the beginning that not everybody has to like recreate everything that's already been done but focus on creating the uh domain specific models uh that solve for the unique problems of the nation that is where the sovereignty you know the aspects such as building a solution based on the nuances of that country using the local data sets um using all of the nuances of the the cultural aspects of that nation is what brings in that those elements of sovereignty and relevance to the nation and also in terms of the whole AI stack uh yes um the foundational layer of infrastructure is definitely essential uh but there are many other pieces ingredients which are equally important um so there's the aspect of ecosystems talent the right partnerships so I would say that silicon and infrastructure the compute is one part but having the data having the talent pipelines having this ecosystem of researchers innovators startups industry is equally important. Um so as Nvidia in fact we play a key role in the compute infrastructure but also across the spectrum in uh in innovation in participating with the research entities um lot of big research you know the all the IITs and schools here is where we collaborate with and the future of AI is really collaborative. >> Okay I'm going to just ask you to uh expand on that a little more. I mean I I know we we think that um the silicon is is sort of the substrate and that's the most important but you're absolutely right that's just where we start. Can you tell us a little bit more about how uh there's resilience that we need further up the stack in you know in a similar way the example that occurs to me is the real cutting edge uh uh performant models are almost like magic right now. Um but not everyone can build that >> but we all don't need these magical things. uh there's a whole bunch of AI that's actually very useful that could potentially perform lower down uh on on the stack and just for the audience to understand because everyone seems to be you know so hung up about the fact that H100s are whatever it is and I don't want to get into the technicalities but you know just the just the the um the the wide range uh in the stack that you can uh use for AI. >> Absolutely. So um you know it's more critical to uh build um domain specific models and you can leverage what is already ex what already exists out there without having to duplicate the large language models and the goodness of that that has already been done. So we don't want to duplicate all that work. uh instead we want to leverage that and that is where uh you know that what makes it sovereign is the ability to tune those models based on the domain specific nation specific um data. Um and of course there's also aspects of governance who is going to manage and continually keep that model updated with the right um local data sets. All of those frameworks are also equally important. Um and those form a very important piece of the sovereignty. Um and there is as you said um you know a lot of uh open models can currently been used in order to build that domain specific model. So uh Sud I'm going to turn to you um and I'm going to turn to you because uh everyone knows uh particularly this week that uh India uh has gone down this path of uh uh promoting uh sovereign AI uh you've been and I want you to talk a little bit about about that you know uh what you've done what India has done uh but you know particularly in the context of this this larger question that I'm talking about um one How why did India decide to go down the path of actually acquiring a lot of compute um uh promoting the creation of 12 foundation models now um and uh supporting that you know financially with all sorts of other support compute support uh etc etc uh what's the Indian strategy given that um uh we now have uh the uh server models being released and we're realizing that the server models are state-of-the-art on many important parameters. Sam is telling me that the question that India cannot compete with global uh models is uh now uh set because we can. Um but I mean it's not just that. So what's the idea? Why is India going down this path uh given that there there are so many complexities and difficulties with it? And once you answer that, I actually really do want you to go into the nuts and bolts of how it's done just in case other nations are are thinking about this. We may not have the capacity of India but how would we do that? >> So thank you very much and namaskar good afternoon to all of you. This topic and the question that you raised is very pertinent especially today when we talk of sovereignty. So today happens to be also Shivaji Janti you come from Punea. uh you told me just before the session. So uh anyone from Punea knows Shivaji and Shivaji has been one of the symbols of sovereignty. The other term is collaboration and collaboration is all what we are seeing today in this conference from 16th. Coming to the specific why India decided to go for a sovereign AI stack is that ultimately it is the strong sovereign nations that can do collaborations for the benefit of humanity. As we all know AI stack has got five layers. The first layer is of course the energy layer. The second layer is the chip layer. The third layer is the data set and the data centers, the cloud service providers. The fourth layer is model and the fifth layer is application. So India AI mission when it was launched in March 2024, it intended to cover all these uh layers with int. Of course the energy was separate part but the second to fifth layer were covered in India AI mission and the purpose of that was that we want to have a sovereign stack so that we can help word and especially the global south to come up with solutions. So we decided to have a compute layer. In compute layer what we have done is that we have uh compute as a service. So we have empanled 14 uh uh service providers CSPs that are they have committed 38,000 GPUs. Another round of empanelment is at the verge of finalization and that mean another 20 25,000 sort GPUs. Then for the chip layer we have launched various schemes like the PLI, DLI, electronics component manufacturing. Of course, Nvidia is going to be a great partner in all that thing and so are the other multinationals that are in this field. And then for the model levels which you asked was that why we have 12 foundational models. So the reason is that we want to have something that has got local context into it. So example if we are using chat GTP and chat GTP I don't know how many languages we have in India. So they may not be able to be that comfortable with that language. So the data set training of chat GTP or any other foreign model will not be based on the datas here. So that is why we have an AI course in our India mission and the data from that AI coach is Indian data and that is used to train these models. So they will be used for various governance issues. As far as the application is concerned uh some few days back someone has said that we are almost the use case capital of the world. In fact, we have got maximum number of applications and application layer is actually one area where we are already the leaders. So these layers are not that they are independent of each other. As far as the energy layer is concerned that is not covered under ministry of electronics and IT but you have very recently seen that the parliament has enacted the Shanti bill and we are looking forward to addressing the energy issue also for this. So ultimately we intend that we should have a sovereign stack but for us sovereignty and collaborations are not contradictory they are complimentary. So I would like to say that sovereign people across uh planet can collaborate to have a progress of humanity. So that addresses all the three sutras the people, planet and the progress. >> Thank you very much because the organizers told me somehow I have to plug people, planet and progress. I think it's been ticked. I don't have to do this ever again. Uh and we can focus on sort of the the the meat of the conversation. I wanted to come back to you because you uh you you you mentioned that we are offering compute as a service. I think it's important to perhaps dig into this a little bit because otherwise I mean the other model and you know I'm going to come to Daniel as well because as we think about compute companies buy compute and then they put out their their their products but if nations buy compute which is what we must think of in order to be um you know smarter about how we do this we have to find a way to provide it as a service and can you just spend a little bit on you know how do I get computers a service if I if I'm a user use case builder. I've got a use case and I need no inference compute because it's okay. uh you know I built the application but many customers are coming to me and they're saying look I want to do an inference uh uh query on this application but I don't have the computer I have a little bit of computer and it's melting because I have so many customers suddenly can the government support with that and and I'm asking this question specifically because I think countries of the world uh perhaps need to look at this model because that is the more efficient and economic way to do this. So one of the main themes for this uh summit is democratization of the as uh AI assets and resources and compute is one of the critical thing among those. So what we have done is that here we empanel then we have a portal on which the user registers after they register they seek a compute if that is available that is allocated to them once that is allocated to them then when they do it or use it the G based on GPU hours then we have the 40% subsidy that we release to them gradually we are going to a stage when we will have adequate compute in fact if you have gone through the budget this year they have g given and also So subsequent the trade deal that has been announced you will see that India is going to emerge as a data center capital or the compute capital of the world. So when that happens then of course India has always been a believer of vasuda kutumbukam the entire world is our family. We come from a civilization that says survey bhavan means let all be happy and the theme of this summit survan servan sukkai is also welfare for all and happiness for all. So India will definitely be contributing on that front. How that happens and when that happens will evolve gradually. As of now we are very clear that we want entire global south to benefit from this AI revolution that is ushering across the globe. So Daniel, I'm going to move to you and as you can see, we're slowly zooming outwards uh from Silicon, which is like the grain of sand. We're now at nation level, but I want to go like larger than nations and you know with CDPI, we we met a while back. Um but arguably um the G20 was when this whole DPI moment happened. uh and um you as with many others have helped take the the idea of DPI to the rest of the world. Uh you do a lot of work in LATAM. Uh but I think almost before your work is done we have this new engine that is powering through which is AI and I think the problems are similar. uh uh you know we felt that nations needed DPI because that was the way to do digitization efficiently but we now know it's quite clear that for developmental objectives AI is going to be a complete game changer but in many of the similar ways but also in very different ways uh rolling out a uh AI is uh challenging and different from the way we rolled out DPI as you speak to countries uh around the world how are they uh thinking about the challenges of uh AI diffusion uh uh what are the constraints that they are feeling in terms of these are their ambitions but this is what uh they're capable of and I also want you to reflect on some of the comments on this that have been made so far is there a as you speak to the countries is there a resilience issue is there a sovereign so sovereign resilience issue and are there any ideas you can get from you know India's approach of say uh computer as a service etc to aggregate demand perhaps It's not just within a single nation but a group of nations like the lat some Latan grouping some African grouping are these thoughts that are that are happening. Sorry I dumped a lot. Pick whatever you want out of it but you know me I I ask complicated difficult that's fine. Uh hi all congrats to MIT for this great week. Um I think I going to be on top of like the five layers of the stack. I'll add the sixth layer which is like India's secret sauce which is people and talent. I think sovereignity it's everything for me it's it's always a reics like we were talking about sovereignity about the cloud two years ago and people were trying governments were trying to build data centers and now they're trying to build AI at the end of the day it's about capacity and it's about it's not just the silicon or the chips or the language models or the foundations it's how pragmatical and agile is a government to create the safeguard cards to move data to have consent to to change models uh to develop the framework for the use cases that idea of having some sovereignity on the process uh that's also it's developing capacity and what we see in the different governments it's that lip throwing lip throgging sometimes it's a thing in digital transformation but going to AI without doing the data and having the data in order and having like basically your DPI on the stack. It's like bar buying a Ferrari and didn't have money for the gas tank and that's how you can define it. Like that's awesome. It's shiny. We cannot use it. So we work with the governments to understand that we need to finally do the homework like you can do AI because you build at a hard you had UPI you have a huge ecosystem of organizations and companies like you have your house in order to then scale and that idea of bringing from technology like into this like even in media like you basically provide my gamer era when I was a kid like how we scale into that it's how you solve a problem. So when we see now in countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, it's like that opportunity to deliver better services like to be more inclusive. Like I will say like I I said this yesterday like bureaucracy it's creates unequality but also creates inflation and creates poverty because it separates and we finally have a tool on like AI to basically kill bureaucracy and make it more efficient. So you mentioned and I really like the analogy of the Ferrari uh without the gas tank, but quite frankly it's the opposite for countries of the global south. We have a lot of gas if data is oil but that gas is useless without a Ferrari. >> Y and so this is the ultimate paradox. uh and how are we going to equip the countries of the global south uh to take advantage of that gas that they have? Um and I mean you really don't need a Ferrari. You could sort of do like a Maruti 800 and you know that's that's okay. But I think there's a there's a countries don't even know how to do that because I we've got gas but it's sort of buried in the ground and we've got to mine it. we've got to refine it and we've got to put it into a shape that's actually capable of being being used. How are we how are the countries of the global south thinking about it? Because my worry I have is that if countries of the global south are not thinking in their sovereign interest um there will be I'm not going to name uh you know corporations that will come and mine for them. And the the unfortunate thing about this is that once it's consumed put into the model then there is a there is a uh it's it's a one time only. Once you've ingested the data then it's gone. Are countries thinking about this? And you know as we go down the panel I want to move to more serious issues around governance as well. Um and this is perhaps a way to start that. >> Yeah I think that there's an evolution about the DPI movement in the different countries that are setting the layers to then connecting to AI like countries creating data exchange platforms and creating payment infrastructures and create digital identity and providing more services there. We're seeing countries and cities and states developing initial chatbots with some services that we're connecting and then creating the infrastructure to do that. I think the the important part is also creating the capacity within the administrations to do that. It's not always deploying something. It's sustaining and evolving that in time that allows administration to deliver services. >> I'm going to uh you know progressively zoom out now. I'm going to zoom from bunch of nations to the planet because you know this is not an unambitious uh panel. Uh and um uh you know having Tulio so Tulio is with the COP 30 presidency. Uh having Tulio here in an AI session the easy uh way to use him is to say you know data centers are bad for the planet and stuff like that. But I'm not going to do that because that's not the way you and I have been talking about this over the years. Right. I think the the um I I I mean I really like your framing of the fact that uh and I want you to I'm going to say it because I don't fully understand it uh the way you said it to me and I'm going to ask you to explain it to the audience and you said that the topology of AI is very similar to the topology of climate change. The language is different but the topology is the same. I instinctively feel that you're on to something but I don't fully understand it. Um, I mean, I I think the point is that there's a lot of data um in in both areas. Um, and perhaps AI has sort of figure out how to harness it a little better than the climate world has figured out how to harness it. Uh, but maybe I'm just sort of uh, you know, putting my words into your mouth, Julio, can you just explain that idea and the role that data uh is is going to play in the climate movement going forward? and you can perhaps start uh on uh by telling us what it the role it played in COP 30 as the first place where we started to talk about this new way of thinking uh about climate change. >> Absolutely. Thank you so much Rahul and it's such a pleasure to be here. um at the very core both the climate challenge and also AI what we're talking about are complex systems and complex systems uh they're very well known for their nonlinear behavior and and and I believe that we all uh see the exponentiality uh in which both AI challenges and solutions and climate challenges and solutions um they are um evolving. So we see climate impacts uh really increasing exponentially uh both in terms of severity uh and frequency but um it's very interesting for example that uh Darod from entropics that we are reaching uh the end of exponentiality which is also another uh behavior of complex systems which is the fact that there is a moment in which a system transitions there is a a moment of phase transition. Uh in AI we are reaching that point. Uh in climate we are reaching that point and what uh um is the biggest challenge of climate change are not actually the extreme weather events but what we call climate induced tipping points. uh tipping points in terms of the collapse the sudden irreversible collapse of geoysical and ecosystems that can trigger one another in a dynamic of cascading and a chain reaction in domino effects. What changes when we are in that perspective is that predictability is no longer the norm. And what does that have to do with sovereignty and nations and AI? Now in a context of uh inevitable unpredictability, nations will have to become themselves collective intelligence ecosystems. And what is interesting in the EI debate is that um for someone from the climate field like I am, the intelligence seems to be confounded with prediction. Prediction is an important but only one lag of intelligence. There is another lag and then coming from the climate we do little prediction but we do a lot of resilience and resilience is the second leg of intelligence which means the capacity of systems be them the economy the society not only to predict imagine a future so that we can transform a future and reach pro prosperity but also the capacity to withstand shocks that we cannot predict. That resilience is a lag that will be extremely important as we now come in a moment of human history in which we are transitioning phases in everything technology, climate, economy, geopolitics. So we will prediction is important but when the unpredictability is the norm the capacity to withstand the unpredictable is even more important and what that debate comes to the AI debate is that the biggest driver of resilience is cohesion. The the biggest driver of cohesion is integration. So there is also a technical discussion that we have here for example DPI and interoperability in integrating um different systems through data from local to global as Shupa has mentioned. >> I want to just dig a little deeper on the interoperability idea. Uh how exactly is that going to work? Because look uh even and Sudep will tell you even within government doing interoperability is is difficult. All of us know in all our governments uh I'm not picking on the Indian government which quite frankly is better than many but it's difficult to do it to now talk about interoperability not just between regional nations but also at a planetary scale and not just that also for multilateral institutions which actually are the repositories of of a lot of the relevant climate data. How are we going to take that step to build that interoperability? Uh you know because it's it's only when the data breaks out of the silos that you can really do effective prediction. I believe that we have a lot of the data. I mean I said you know I said we have to mine the data but but perhaps at the international climate level the data is already fairly good. It's just not connected. And if it does get connected, the intelligence that we can get out of that is will be incredibly powerful. Almost to the point where I think that I mean I I don't want to say we'll solve climate change, but perhaps hidden in that are some ideas as to how to do it in a easier, more efficient way than what we thought we were doing. I'm new to the climate change arena, but I realize it they're doing this on on Excel or even maybe on paper. a lot of the uh the commitments. I can't believe that in this day and age that's the way we we uh measure our commitments. >> Absolutely. This is a great example of the languages being different but the topology being the same. Uh the climate regime was actually born with the idea of transparency and comparability of emissions data. This is interperability. So what is missing now is uh how do we connect everything so that the data that is comparable and interoperable can actually not only be um PDFs and and and reports that um are uploaded but actually um uh data and value that can uh be uh benefited from um AI. for example for prediction but for uh resilience as as well. So what we see now in the climate challenge is that uh we have a lot going on in terms of solutions in terms of finance in terms of initiatives in terms of engagement. It's absolutely everything fragmented. And another uh principle of complexity science as well is that the more connections we are able to have the fastest and the biggest scale we get. So um again uh we are in a situation in which um there is a huge opportunity to unify the digital and the climate twin transitions now so that they become a one single revolution towards prosperity because if we don't do it now they will be merged in the future not as opportunities but as risks And Shabba, you picked up the the mic. I feel that you wanted to intervene, but but I also want you to just pick up on uh you the point on governance because everything that we're unpacking here has some fairly significant governance issues and I also want to zoom back the same way, right, from the micro all the way up, but yeah, I I mean I I know that um you and Tulio are speaking a lot about digital twins and those sorts of things. So please uh >> yeah I was going to add to what Julio was saying in terms of uh how uh technology and specifically AI in fact can solve for this complex domain of climate um because of the way in which the old uh numerical methods which the old physics- based methods uh were just very very complex um intensive and those actually can be solved by AI and um in fact at Nvidia we have undertaken the challenge of building a digital twin of the whole planet earth. And so that is truly a gamecher in the way you can start to predict the impact of certain um combinations of certain events and how the climate is going to affect different things such as um you know natural disasters or sea level rise and so on and so forth. So it's a very powerful tool in terms of predicting uh and simulating um how climate is going to start impacting livelihoods and economies. >> I'm going to turn to the audience for questions in a bit but I want to get some very quick um responses uh from the panel. Sep I'll come to you once again on on the governance issue. I mean you know there's this alignment that the models have which in a sense is its own governance and that comes from the people who build the models. Now if we have only one model obviously we can completely control alignment but you you've chosen to get 12 models and we've got likely to have uh different alignments and I think I'm asking the question not because of India. I'm asking the question because we are going to have different models that are coming out. We've got Chinese models, we've got French models and we're going to have uh many countries saying look I want to do my own model. I'm wondering whether this is going to cause us to splinter more in in uh governance or is there any other idea? Obviously, we have rules that we all have to abide with but there are shades of gray and how do we think about governance in this world of multiple models. >> So basically uh India is a diverse country and world has got even more diversity. So obviously if you want to have just one model then I think it is not possible to capture each and every aspect of it. The more the diverse ecosystem you have the more the number of models you can have because the models are primarily designed to solve the problems. So use cases will vary from model to model and the local contextualization is very important. So having one model is something which is not the right way to go about. We have selected uh 12 startups and in this uh summit itself you have seen that some of them have come up with the launch of their models and many more mod models are likely to be launched shortly. Also uh the selection procedure for more startups for developing the foundation models is uh at an advanced stage and we can hear some good news on that front also. So having more models is a good in a way but yes we do need benchmarks and that benchmarks can vary from country to country provided the broad governance structure ensures that there is no unsafe or unreliable use of AI because that is a very critical concern we have to ensure that the ethical AI is there across the globe but there will be different models there should be million flowers that should blossom on that front but yes at the same time the governance has to be uh more streamlined activity. Now India released this governance guidelines in November 25 and here we put trust at the forefront. So we encourage trust, we encourage innovation but at the same time we also want that the AI should be safe and reliability. So if you go through that document these are the the theme it is focusing on and I think word especially global south can take lot of clues out of that model. I want to pick two things up from that one for Daniel and one for Tulio. I I so so Daniel the the discussion here has been um uh you know how how do we I I I hate pessimistic conversations and and I think one of the uh the the things that this conversation has uh thrown up is that the power of data you know the way Tulio says it um comes from the interoperability uh core to that is the ability to exchange data I know you've spent a lot of time thinking through u data exchanges and and how that would work at a very mundane level I guess for DPI but now there's the opportunity to do it for a much more um you know a larger predictive level uh what are the governance things we need to think about as we build data exchanges for for AI uh both from the perspective of one safeguarding the data as well as from the perspective of uh dealing with national sovereignity a short answer and today I want to pick I want you to think about the concept of trust and at a multinational level particularly at a very fragmented time right now you have a very difficult job of sort of creating trust in uh nation states in order to achieve our common goal but but first on exchanges okay super short I think the key for that is how you architect the solution how basically you orchestrate the use of data how you invoke tools to the models if you are using agents or whatever I think that idea of orchest station like keep keeping that layer on controlling the use case on how data flows and which tools are being invoked or pulling into the agents and being executed by the models I think is that it's treating if we're talking about AI being like a modular thing we can take the best thing of the world and so we can use like different models we can use like different infrastructure yes and we can play with the different blocks like it's a DPI approach on to AI at the end of the day without being that romantic idea. But I think that part of orchestration will be key for the governments or the countries to maintain control on their sovereignity but also use the best of the world and Tulio on on trust and if you've got questions just raise your hand. I don't know how the oh my goodness me a lot of oh good lord people are standing up because they got so but Tulio quickly because we don't got want to get in the way of people and their questions. >> Absolutely. Well, on on trust um the the key and that's the most fascinating about presiding a cop at this moment is the notion of interdependence and this is something that in the global south we starting to realize that it's intuitive from our econom cultures. We know we are interdependent. So trust is emerging from the global south and through a new perspective of governance that is not building blocks and castles but actually ecology and this is very much aligned with DPI for example that is radically modular. So instead of having uh this uh uh big ambition of starting with everything, we start little and organically uh enhancing trust. >> Okay, I'm going to go to the audience for questions. I have a rule. This is a question, not a statement. So if you can't end with like a question, don't start. Uh so I'm just going to pick a gentleman there. uh he was very eager but I'm going to pick three questions so I'll pick a few others yes a question really short no the guy behind you >> yeah my question >> yeah yeah yeah sorry I just I'll give it don't worry we'll get you yeah >> question yeah yeah yeah we are finding that as far as these LLMs are concerned you know Nvidia etc they're launching lot of connectivity with hyperscalers but not with smaller businesses for example DGS DGX hardware is still very expensive and uh also so how can Can we I mean uh uh interconnect integrate with the small businesses for the >> how can we do small rural businesses >> how can we do small businesses right okay so let's get that get another question y >> yeah my question is more about the future outlook in next 10 years do you foresee AI alliance similar to defense alliance >> AI alliance like a defense alliance >> yes >> uh I don't know who's going to take that but let's just take one here and then we'll go to this side of the room we'd get three questions we'll get three more questions from Yeah. >> Yeah. Um while we're talking at the national level and everything, large language models definitely make sense. The question is more and more the return on investment for commercial organizations is only going to be on small language models. So in that sense the coop issue of about looking at energy requirements all can come down. Any thoughts on the future of know SLMs and how this whole concept can change? >> Okay. So we got we got three questions. I think the the first and the third question are sort of similar in the sense that uh one we want to you we want to how do we use it for small models maybe chop you can take that uh and I think certainly the SLM question is a is a Tulio question uh the uh the alliances perhaps Daniel you can take that don't think about a defense alliance but just think about an an alliance I think that's an interesting question uh no one on the panel has got a defense background so we not be able to give a specific answer but cha just really quickly because I want to get three more from you >> yeah certainly so um I think you know How do we get um small businesses um right to to innovate and >> I think the question was but you're you're selling to the hyperscalers but but >> yeah but actually through our collaborations such as with the Indian government in fact with the India mission uh that effort is truly to um democratize the access of AI to startups tomemes to come and access and build um you know on top of that infrastructure. So uh we are truly doing um everything in the way of engaging with ecosystem as well because we have a program called inception which is a virtual incubator for startups through which we provide access to you know GPUs and things like that. So we have some programs available inhouse in order to >> it exists there there are programs you just have to dig and find it. Daniel, if you can uh I mean are we doing alliances because it seems to make sense some countries are too small but they will become bigger once they ally with other countries. Are we doing those alliances for AI? Would that be an interesting thing to do? >> Um yeah so two answers in one basically I love small language models. Governments only need a small language model. You are not doing rocket science. Uh that brings into we got alliance on clusterings like what happened with small islands small countries uh regional things. I don't have I don't have an idea what's going to happen in 10 years. I don't know like I don't know what's going to happen. What I know is like it's going to have a regional view. It's going to be reused and trying to and sharing make us all better. If you see the progress in the humanity is about sharing knowledge >> and Julia the flip side of the small language because if the languages are small they're not going to burn that much compute or energy and then we won't have a problem with climate change. So you know and maybe that's the that's the thing that we have to look at the positive side. That's that's one uh aspect and and and obviously small language models will be very much key for the climate challenge especially in terms of uh locality but again uh coming back to Daniel's point if we don't integrate data uh we language models they're not going to be uh sufficient and then also talking about the alliance with AI um President Lul is coming to India also here and u this model of alliance is already emerging of of a third way in which Brazil and India for example are already um uh will be announcing a digital partnership the difference is it's not only a digital partnership for Brazil and India but in benefit for the global south so there will be some announcements also uh on the notion of planetary intelligence that is open uh for the global south. >> Okay, announcements coming. Um I want to pick three questions from here. There's a gentleman who is sitting I mean if you take the effort to sit in the front row you should be rewarded but there's a lady sitting in the back row and I'm going to give equal reward for the lady in the back row. >> Three questions I'm going to pick up. >> Rahul actually question very short question actually in India our legal processes are very lengthy and very slow. I just want to know your response how our sovereign AI models are going to help and improve our legal processes. >> See the moderator is not supposed to answer questions. Okay, I'll take that. The lady the the lady uh >> Thank you. very quickly um culturally India is diverse. So >> louder just put the mic closer because I can't hear and I just want a question. >> Yes. Sovereign AI stack for India how do we ensure it's consentdriven and bias free? >> Okay. So that Sudep is going to answer. How do we ensure sovereign AI models are consentdriven and >> bias free? Wow. Okay. And there was a question there. Yeah. Hello everyone. So my question is so EI right I mean so we are going to be create AI for the different different industry specific like we did for the healthare or finance specific right? I mean then how the government can help us to validate it or maybe it's compliance level valid or not. I mean right that's very much important. >> Okay. So that two questions for Sudep right. So uh uh why don't you take the two uh I have a small mind. I can only keep three questions at a time. I'll get I'll get you. So let's just do it quickly. Yeah. So so one is this how do we um uh ensure governance and consent and then how do we ensure validation? I think these are uh two similar questions that perhaps you can answer. >> Yeah. And just I would like to add one thing to the previous question about the SLMs. So out of the 12 uh foundation models, four are SLMs. And as far as the Indian story is concerned, SLMs are going to play a very critical role. You see, most of our problems, day-to-day issues are domain specific. SLMs are going to be very impro important there. Government realizes it and we are definitely working on it. So SLM foundation models are somewhere at the very core of our thinking. Now coming to the other question which was pertaining to how we intend to have the consensus uh for the AI stack that we made. So for that data protection bill is already an act now. So your data cannot be used without your consent. We have got AI governance guidelines in place and we have got transparency in form of AI course. So whatever data we are using it is available. So it if there's some bias it will obviously be visible to all. So we are very committed that our data which is used for training and inferencing is free from any biases and the privacy of individuals are protected through data protection act. >> Excellent. And uh we have just one minute left so unfortunately I'm just going to answer this one question. uh you know I mean lawyers live on the fact that it's complex and that no one can understand how it works and so you have to come to me pay me a lot of money to explain it to you to now say that AI is going to now make me redundant is a horrible way to end the session but I I I agree that uh very very quickly uh uh the friction that exists because of these inefficiencies uh are going to go away uh because quite frankly AI is going to make this a lot easier to do and even even though I made that opening remark in justest as a lawyer nothing would make me happier than to see a lot of these frictions go away and for us to be able to live uh in in the world in a much more uh efficient way. Uh the time is up. I want to thank you all for being a wonderful audience and I want to thank the panel for a very very enriching and enlightening conversation. You
