Hi.

I’m Shagun, and I go by id10t on the Internet. I’m doing my undergrad right now, majoring in Computer Science. My primary interest is security—information, operational and national. Espionage and military tactics interest me deeply, and I love discussing them.

I care about software freedom and digital privacy, and I am a staunch advocate of the same. I try to use free alternatives to software, if they exist.

I write code at times, begrudgingly. Take a look at my projects on GitHub.

Here are some of my links:

My Twitter DMs are open, but I may take a while to reply. 
If you’re interested in hiring me—here’s my résumé.
