Free Trials for end users are a great way to experience the platform and extract the most value out of it while you have the time, which is a natural behavior for us humans.

But on the other end are teams deciding whether to have a trial in the first place or a free Plan maybe a freemium plan for their product.

Free Trials as a rule of thumb should only be introduced when your product/offering is 
- mature
- out of MVP/PMF stage
- has a considerable value that can make the customers pay for it.

Within PM, it is essential to look at the problem from different perspectives and zoom out to focus on the bigger picture.

In choosing an optimal free trial one length has to look at:
- Existing product business model
- the value it can generate from the trial
- data and insights on similar product categories
- positioning and messaging of your trial

A wrong trial setup will only lead you to onboard multiple users and dilute product value. It is important to find the right balance of business requirements, timings, product USP and pricing structure with all other details involved to make for the best Trial experience.

The following covers research from various products that have introduced different free trial models and their details.
