### Health
One thing that we often neglect to look after in this busy life schedule is to look after our health,start to take care of  your health and making sure that health should be the first priority kyuki **jaan he to jaha he**,as someone told.
The quarantine has helped me focus on my health and things are amazing.Take care of your health y'all.

### Vim
I am in love with vim,not that is use it as my main ~~"IDE"~~ editor.It has improved my speed 10-folds and now I feel like the 10x developers out there.Integrating Vim keybinds to the browser with Vimium extensions and configuring my file manager with vim keybinds has been great so far.
It does have a steep learing curve but it is all worth it at the end.
Using extensions and optimizing workflow is the best way to ***bash harder with Vim***.


### Tech
Being in the field of tech has it's **ups & downs**, you get to work with cutting edge tech and develop cool products.
But somewhere in all of this we have lost the understanding of ethics and practical use over making tools/products that end up exploiting people's privacy & data.

I've often listened people talking about "data is the new oil" and trust me that is not something to feel good about or be excited for.
Well it has it's ***"ups & downs"***.
An individual in the tech industry should always try to understand about the reprecussions and harm over good a product or software can have to the society.
Tech has it's own points and one has to be extra careful with the details to care of during development.

Technologies like AI,facial recognition have become great research topics and often lead to double edge sword results and often resulted with biased results rather than anything effective.

Always take a step back and consider the ethics and reason for development rather than ending up exploiting tech for bad over good.
I can write about tech/policy/ethics for days,probably in a future post.

**Writing your own Tools**
##### and using SuckLeSS softwaRE

With open-sourcing,writing tools & mainting them (still a noob doe), writing my own tools and learning by making has been a great way to learn the ever growing technologies.

I updated [sub3num](https://github.com/shagunattri/sub3num) with new & better addons,optimizations also,made a [todo](https://github.com/shagunattri/todo) list in node.

Still alot more tool&projects to come as WIP....

### News & Disinformation
With the digital age,

We are more than ever connected and stuck to our screens looking at news from around the world all day long.
Disinformation is on the surge where even the smarty pants fall prey to fake news,and we have made a situation for ourselves where in we cannot trust a news without looking at 10 other sources and confirming it as a true or not.

Don't get me wrong being up-to-date with news/tech/etc is good,but recently I have come to a conclusion where I have reduced my news consumption to the minimun and spending quality time gardening in my small garden at home.


This toot puts it in a better way about news we consume.

### The Setu Saga 
Aarogya setu is a disguise or a great app is for you to decide.I personally have not used it on my phone and have been continuosly looking at the app and observing it,many things don't look good
where we don't have any info about the endpoints,how the data is stored and how are audits done on the app yada,yada.

For the past few days many have confirmed that the app open-sourced on github is not the same app realeased on people's devices,it is just a cloned version of it and the real development is somewhere else with private-govt. partnerships.
There is effectively no proper interaction with the devs while most of pull requests and issues are unanswered with very less "open-source" if you may put it as.
