***Comes down to how you switch gears***

When in college folks are ambitious(sort of) and curious to learn new fancy buzzing tech only to get sidetracked into one niche and never be able to concentrate on the real goal at hand of finding out what they really enjoy doing; and ending up to just focus on the next big trendy shiny tech that is making the rounds. AI is one such rn.

Exploring on one side, learning, and understanding the market is key as this is finally where you will eventually be working in. 

A lot of the time college does not provide current market insights unless you are in touch with a seasoned individual in the industry or in contact with people who can guide you in the right way.

Have seen folks get stuck with the next-new fluff in the market and go all-in betting everything on a tech stack for eg. and down the road realize it is a dead end with limited options. 

`e.g:` Flutter, sorry not sorry - iska time bhi aayega

All that needs to be done is looking at things from a macro lens and picking from a combination of skills that together put on a show and provide you the ability to get opportunities.

YouTube and tutorials on the internet are to blame - they create hype over new tech, get folks interested who are new in the game - make them cheerleaders building the tech cult. These folks learn the fundamentals of a tech stack for “beginners“ but never figure out how these stacks are used in the industry.

DevOps as an example sounds fancy and exciting with the tools and cloud capabilities you work with but at the end of the day, it is about making sure your deployments go live on time with the release build failures.

If I were to design an ideal candidate profile I would have a skill cocktail 🍸 of:

`Role: DevOps Engineer`
- DevOps + Backend Engineering + AWS + Ansible
sounds like a profile that has room to start with DevOps → and get into Backend → Cloud Engineering → Automation Engineer.
- Combinations like these can create endless possibilities where you can build and grow leaving room for options.

> It's ok to explore, experiment, and learn about a new tech but it comes down to finding the right time to switch gears and knowing the time to go all-in with a tech stack while having an overview of what the market trend is to bet on skills that give the best ROI.

ok, bye
