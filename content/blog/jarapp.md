Jar brings conventional gold investment that is now trusted for generations to the digital world with a simple usecase to solve for - make investing in digital gold seamless and easy.

Jar added features with gamification and ability to invest with ease by availing rewards and purchasing gold in the process in the simplest way possible.

It helps invest in a habit that can then be automated with the help of AutoPay.

### Jar's Core Insights

A lot of the Indian population from Tier 2/3 region have always dreamed of making it big, having watched heroes flaunt money in movies, their cousins from Tier 1 cities flaunting brands, and wanted all those things, but could never afford one.

With money,:
- No one taught us how to behave with money.
- No one taught us how to build the right habits and relationships.
- No one taught us discipline around money. 

Jar main intention was to bring the concept of investing to the masses and define the ability for
### Here's my beef with JarApp

The JarApp has a lot of features that are rare for me at least to use and manage my goal of releasing input every.
- Never understood the use case of vasooli bhai.
- Finding out spare change and notifying expenditure does not work on iOS properly.
- Makes it hard to claim the rewards the platform generates.

### Why I started using Jar

- Rapid growth during the pandemic
- everyone on Twitter was talking about it
- recently funded
- Helps build habits
- rewards users
- simple and sleek UI inspired from CRED neumorphism
- crazy numbers
- do the simple basics right

### Why it works

There is no platform for the common man to do things in a small, simple manner and that was the triggering point for us
A platform that will help people start, and build the right habits around investments, build the right relationship with money, and slowly from there we will help them diversify into multiple investments.

> Gold is something that everyone understands. 

The relationship with money is not the same for everyone. You need to first build a habit, and discipline behavior and then teach them about diversified asset classes, hedging the risk, long-term plans, and goals.

### Typical Jar User Flow

 -> Pay using UPI - Round-off amount -> notify of change in every transaction -> incentivise to invest -> Invest -> reward with a free spin -> Invest in Gold

Another eg of gamification and forming habits for users is with Apple Fitness Rings, Cred also to an extent does this with reminders to pay credit card bills.

### Why it doesn't work anymore for me?

- Clunky calculations and purchase experience from 
- You can't spend your rewards to make a purchase and spend them at once
	- was possible earlier, may be done to improve their margins
- Buying and selling gold is clunky; and the app doesn't make me confident of my transaction
- Daily savings from the transaction spare amount and investment doesn't work on iOS
- Has dark patterns around spending the rewards

### What JarApp can do to improve from here?

- Better sections and widgets across the app with better tooltips 
- Simplify and add UX with what they see on the screen
- Provide new features with more visibility and nudges to experiment
- Expand and allow to make rules on gold investments based on transaction triggers
- Provide a better overview and transaction state of affairs with recommendations
- Reduce the wasted white space across pages

### Final Thoughts

- The JarApp will need more robust habit building features to solve for Daily Savings habit building.
- The usecases are limited but will need findings problems that are regular among massess.
- Super apps like Paytm, PhonePe and others can just build the same feature and beat them.
- Need to incentivise usage with features they offer.
- Build better journeys for delighting customers.
