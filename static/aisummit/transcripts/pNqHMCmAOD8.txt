limited to a few. It must be for all. Open-source hardware and software play a critical role in this journey. They lower barriers, accelerate innovation, empower learners, developers and industry to build without constraints and that is why this conversation matters. To take us deeper into how this vision is being realized, it is my pleasure to invite Mr. Fabio Vilante, VP and GM Arduno, who will share how Ardino is advancing AI democratization globally. Fabio, the stage is yours. >> Thank you very much. It's a big pleasure to be here today. So uh India is in my heart always pleasure meeting all the clever people that uh that you have in startups in schools and also in enterprise. So today we need to be quick because we have a lot going on in this presentation and I would like to start talking about you know a little bit what is happening in the world. So and what happens when with the AI when AI becomes physical this is very important because we are living in a moment in time where AI is no longer abstract it's no longer just software but it is in farms it is in industry it is on your body with the wearable device and uh of course this require different pace in developing innovation there is an old pay with closed system with elite access only and with few thousand engineers developing uh code and developing hardware. But the new way that is very needed for physical AI is based on open platforms. It is based on accessible technology for everyone and is also a much broader developer base that is required. So I think India has a lot of superpowers. This is very very important because we are in a country that has some secret weapons. First of all scale. India is a gigantic country with a lot of smart people and this is very very important. But India also is used to cope with constraints that are becoming a big opportunity because you have real world limitation in energy for example or uh sometimes in accessing networks and people have to build real solution to those problems and this solution will become an opportunity for creativity and I think creativity is the key when it comes to physical AI because basically what you build are not only prototypes but these are resilient systems that can be applied on a much broader scale in different areas. So this is I think your secret weapon and something that is pretty unique in the world. So what is happening with physical AI is that intelligence is moving at the edge. So this means that you are running AI algorithms close to sensors, close to motors, actuators and also to people. And in other world when intelligence moves closer to the physical world, hardware matters again because you are very close to where the problem is. Is no longer in a data center far away from you. And uh this needs more design and integration. So not just assembling things but uh rapid iteration and system thinking this is very crucial. So people need to be fast because the problems are continuously changing data continuously changing and uh we believe as Qualcomm and Arduino that India is ready and is positioned really to compete in this in this world. Just a bit of history about Arduino. I don't know if you're familiar with the history of Arduino, but just a few words. So this is the place where Arduino was born. But Arduino was not born as a company. Arduino was an idea that came from faculty of this school is called interaction design institute of Ibraa. That is a small city, a small village north of Torino in the northern part of Italy. This was one of the first schools in the world uh about 25 years ago teaching physical computing. So bringing intelligence to physical objects and this is how it started because the faculty of this school basically had a challenge. The challenge was to let people with different background not only electrical engineers but also designers uh medical doctors. So the students in this school had a very very big diversity but they didn't know how to program software but also how to make uh hardware. So the challenge so the person in the picture is the one of the co-founders the most most important co-founder of Arduino Masimobanzi that basically reverted the paradigm. So instead of frontal education he was teaching project based learning to enable those people to start getting some results and then understand what was uh the technology behind these things and by developing continuously prototypes they had the challenge that every project was one of a kind. So they come up with this idea of finding the smallest possible computer available that was the microcontroller in terms of computing and then they had the challenge of creating a language that would be easy to learn for people with not without a engineering background and this is how they came up with the idea of creating a board that could be standardized for all the projects for the students. Seven years later they this project became so successful because it was also and this is very important open source was the first largecale open-source hardware and software project in the world beside the Linux operating system. So they came up with the idea of creating a company and as many of you probably know uh there is always a struggle in finding a good name for projects for startups etc. So they were having the same struggle. So they were sitting in a bar in Irea called Barardduino. So at some point they were fed up of not finding a name. So they Masimo came with the idea of calling the project with the name of the bar. So Arduino is the name of the bar where they were sitting. So talking about India, you see in this chart the number of downloads of the Arduino ID that is our on premises development tool in the last 12 months. more than 36 million downloads of the ID globally. But look at the bar there, the green bar is India, the second largest community in the world. So, and has been always the second largest community. The swap that happened in the last three months is that China went over US. So, US was number one uh and China was number three and they swapped. Don't ask me why. But uh you see how many people are using Arduino both with official products very little and also with uh clones products or compatible products. This is very important because there is a huge community of people using our platform. So what we have seen I've been with Arduino for the last 10 years as CEO now part of walcomm and uh we identified a path so basically a path for people developing uh on Arduino. from the exploration phase when you do prototypes to building and creating working prototypes to deployments in in a smaller scale to scaling because Arduino is not only used by educators and individuals but is now pervasive also in small medium enterprise and also departmental initiatives of large enterprise. So this is very very important because this is a pattern that we identified and it's basically a journey that we see for a lot of young people uh like uh the majority of the crowd in the in the room and the people that probably are following us. So there is a new way of becoming developers and thinking about integration of hardware and software. So the idea of course is uh to move from prototyping to platform. This is very important because you need to start thinking about how to scale in order to have an impact in our society. So we know for sure that India prototype fast just few seconds ago we had a I took a picture with the team here in the room and they were showing a nice robot for uh disaster management and uh environmental uh protection. So and this prototype was built with a bunch of Arduinos. So and with the Arduino software. So for sure you know how to prototype fast. So the point is that if you want to impress a prototype is the right thing to do. You do nice prototype like the the prototype that I just saw. But if you transform the prototype into a platform, the platform endures. So it's very very important to have this paradigm shift because basically this allow you to scale and uh the point I think for India is that if you start managing this transition from basically prototyping to platform you don't create just yet another startup so the world is packed with startups but if you create a global platform that go that can go within India but also beyond the boundaries of India you have a real impact. So the platform that you build shape industries. So there are a few things that are very important uh in order to get to from prototyping to platform. First of all thinking about manufacturing pathways. So creating accessible route from design to production. This is very very important. The hardware capital. So investments that understand hardware reality because hardware is hard. So this is an important paradigm shift that especially people involved in supporting those startups and this ecosystem needs to understand. So the India is known for a service economy. So basically it's more frugal working capital kind of mindset. When it comes to hardware, you have to think long long term. And I'm really proud to be part of the Qualcomm family because today we just announced a fund specifically for India of 150 million for early stage startup. So we were with the CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano among this morning and with our Qualcomm venture team that has a presence in India pretty strong and they announced this investment. It's really huge because Qualcomm is a company that can provide money but also has is a technology company. I have been acquired in my previous life once and we had a sales company with a little bit of technology. So if you look at walcomm is exactly the reverse. It's just a gigantic R&D focused on innovation from two nanometers chipset to very advanced software define define radio for every kind of uh communication network. So basically having this fund is extremely important. So get in touch, look at the press today because you will see the announcement. And then of course there is a call also for the education part because we have to start teaching not only what to do and uh why you do those things but also teach about how to start productizing things. So my learning when I joined Arduino from a PhD in software I didn't know anything about hardware. So getting from ideas that were shiny and very nice into things that you can scale adds a lot of complexity. You have to design for manufacturing. You have to think what components you're using, how to rationalize your bill of material. All things that you will approach once you get into the product world. So I strongly believe and as as a as a company strongly believe that basically the physical AI is going to be transformational for the next decade. It's very very important. So AI at the edge, intelligence inside machines, device, robot, infrastructure, everything will be transformed and uh this will help support lower latency, better privacy and basically increase reliability of the system. So this is a very important part. So the other point is ambient intelligence. So basically making intelligence invisible so that basically you don't have to add complexity to people life. You are removing complexity by hiding intelligence into a solution. But all these things that are nice words that you see on my slide they have only one way to be developed. So you need builders and you don't need builders in the ivory tower. You don't need like a few builders that are sitting in the best university of Bangalore, Delhi, Milano or San Diego or San Francisco. You need like a large number of people coming with different background just as I was telling the history of Arduino that take the problem, approach the problem, slice the problem and uh learn while doing things. This is I think the secret source for success. So I think that uh just quickly recapping India has the democratic the culture the developer density the ambition and the urgency. This morning we were with the ministry uh of electronics, communication and transportation. One of the smartest person that I ever met in my my life talking about exactly this topic urgency, ambition and potential. So and the young population you have is like really really important because basically new idea come from people that uh approach the problems with a fresh mindset. So if we give the right tools access platform so we will have a country that is not going to be a follower or just implementing someone else's thoughts but can be a country that shape the future. So I think we don't need another Silicon Valley replica. So every time so I come from Europe you know we are not Italy is not really known even though we have nice startups and companies but basically it's not known for being like the Silicon Valley but all the VCs and everyone the ecosystem they keep saying we need to build the Silicon Valley of uh Europe. So basically we don't need another Silicon Valley. What we really need in this country is a Indian model for physical AI built at scale under constraint because this constraints will not go away but basically everything is more affordable and I think one of our uh you know mission for Arduino is to make technology accessible by lowering the barrier to entry in terms of cost of the products in terms of complexity to learn those products. So if we do all all of this I think there is a a very important India moment that we need to uh exploit. So just a simple call to action before wrapping. So basically there are few actors. So we have to talk about an ecosystem of actors. There are educators. The important thing is that you are very effective in teaching the your discipline but you have to teach confidence not just curriculum. That's very important point. Let student build before they feel re ready. So this is very important. You saw Masimo making a project with students. This is the right approach in my humble opinion. Students you you have to start before you feel qualified. It seems strange but with platforms like Arduino today you can start and get to the final result and then say okay how what can I change? How can what do I need to learn to change and make an impact? Startups. So the point is we don't need one-off startups prototyping startups because these companies will not get funded will go nowhere. If you design for repeatability for pattern that can be scaled beyond the boundaries of your school or the your startup or your house then you will have a likelihood to succeed that is one million times bigger. And of course industry. So you have fantastic companies here you know naming some like data so it's a global player so automotive technology so you have appliance companies you have everything uh already in place but those company they have to open their platform so to create more synergy synergies with education more synergies with startups with students and also policy makers they have an important role of course they have to accelerate pathway way from lab to factory. There are a lot of initiatives and we will see them in a minute. Some practical example of collaboration u of important institution uh with industry and this is something that needs to be continuously facilitated. So I think just wrapping with a single sentence is that together we can create not just innovation but we create capabilities and those capability compound. So that's to me very important message that I would like to convey and then leave the stage to my colleague that is senior director of sales global sales at Arduino Gunit Pedi. Thank you very much. >> Thank you Fabio. Thank you very much. >> Hi everybody. Good to see everybody here. Um I wanted to give you a little bit of a next step analysis and announce some collaborations that we're very excited about in u the Indian context. Um so you know as you see um Arduino as ecosystem is an ecosystem built for really hands-on and both from a learning as well as prototyping to production. We have various functions in here which is for developers, makers, for education but also for industry. Today you will see a perfect example of collaboration which is from school to career. Right? So you will see examples of where we're partnering with uh really really amazing companies locally to start in the K12 school space get into the higher education university space. We'll see some innovations coming from uh students on you know the innovation that can happen very quickly you know in in an innovation contest and then we'll also talk about some industry use cases which are being deployed at platform and at scale with some of our partners right so we'll see all that today um you know one thing which I wanted to leave you guys with before we get into the announcement part is um a lot of you might know Arduino as a starting point of a very basic 8-bit microcontroller but we've come a long way Right. And I think this is very important for you to understand. You know, the latest product portfolio we've launched as a part of the Qualcomm family actually gets a very advanced AI capability at the edge. So we call it the UNO Q. And you know the tagline we have internally is uh from blink all of you remember blinking and LED as your first project to think. How can we actually have thinking happening at the edge uh and without the dependency on the cloud as uh Fabia was talking about right because uh it's everything cannot just happen in the cloud especially in India right I think this is very very important you know you'll see some examples of how constraints are actually a strength that we have as a country and you know we can drive that towards global uh innovation so I think that's very very important to see uh that's a new product if you haven't seen it that's a new collaboration I call it a platform this is what we will use to create a huge ecosystem uh in India to create everything from learning to curriculum to doing to actually a lot of additional industry experiences which will come in and drive an ecosystem of a single board computer. So I think it's very important for you us uh to take this next step from a you know basic uh electronics into the age of AI uh which you know is perfect because we're at the AI impact summit and this is good to see that AI can be available in less than 6,000 rupees right so I think it's really important to kind of put that in today um in addition to the $150 million fund that Fabio talked about for startups we're launching a program in India called AI for all right AI should not be limited to the ivory tower as you said Fabio I think it should be for all uh we will use this to educate millions and millions of learners the idea is to educate of course do the education with experience you know uh of course I grew up in India all parts of India my father was in the army and then I've been living in the US for about 19 years now and it's amazing to see the difference of instructorled learning versus self-paced learning that we see across the western and eastern world and I think there's no right or wrong but the right is a mix if we can mix the combination of instructorled and the um you know the self-paced learning I think that'll be very interesting and of course we want to use this for scale and the scale will come with um you know you guys creating solutions which will actually solve real world problems as well as uh the funding will help to drive ecosystem of startups right so I think that's that's the forall program um and with that I'd like to invite on stage stage one of our first uh strategic partners. Uh we have a couple of partners coming in from here from the Arvin Maflal group as well as from um get set learn. So I'd like to invite on stage to announce the collaboration uh with Mr. Priatra Maflal who's the managing director and um Mr. Amit uh who's the CEO of Get Setle Learn. Please come on stage. We'd like you to come and talk about Get Setle Learn. I don't know why the slides are running. They're excited to see you. Hi, that's good to see you. Thank you for making the trip. By the way, it's his birthday today. So, look at his commitment that he come all the way from Mumbai for this event. >> Yes. And Amit. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Uh we'll get some mics for you guys. And I'd love for you to kind of guide us on what you're doing and how you're enabling AI for all. >> No, I wouldn't have missed it. Um thank you, Gon. Thank you. um to the entire team and we're extremely excited to work with uh both Arduino and Qualcomm. We have grand plans uh to you know look at the education space and hopefully in the next one or two years we're going to see millions and millions of learners actually benefit from this. But um thank you guys. >> Uh thank you so much. I know uh you know we've spoken about this a lot uh and I think Fabio and Gonit have covered most of it. Uh essentially you know the mandate and the vision is to bring schools to careers and uh put employability as the focus. We going to create a workforce of almost 250 million uh you know people from India. And uh to do that we're kind of bringing an integrated future skills curriculum. We're bringing uh content on devices as well as we are trying to automate the ATL labs and kind of make them far more uh uh you know effective than they are currently. So having said that I'm very excited uh for the vision that we are building with Ardino and Qualcomm and uh here's looking to the future. Thank you. >> Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you guys. We look forward to the partnership. Oh, I don't need two mics. [laughter] Um, and I think the important thing I want to also talk about is K12 is the foundation of where these learning skills starts. Arvid Maflal group and getert learn will be the partner who will drive that innovation jointly with us create curriculum and drive that. Thank you. Drive that uh going forward. You know with that um we took this principle of hands-on learning in reality. We had 100 teams which participated in an innovation challenge from various universities and we only gave them two weeks and we gave them the board. We gave them some kits and said let's come up with some ideas of real world problems. Today we're going to uh Fab if I could request you to come on stage to award the teams. Uh we're going to award the top three teams. We got 37 projects. 20 of them made the cut of our engineering team. So our engineering team reviewed every project and the top three teams are here today. They were also showcasing the demo on the Qualcomm booth. If you have time, please go to Barat Mandepam and see the demos there. It's very very fascinating. The first team uh which created this solution was a smart stick. Um and you know this was a very interesting idea because you know you're taking it from your variable into an elderly cane or elderly stick. And the idea there is you can do real-time biometrics analysis as well as you can do algorithms and AI at the edge without any dependency on cloud if somebody is falling. So you can very quickly alert as well as protect and you know uh make lives better for very elderly. So I'd like to invite on stage the IIT Delhi team which is Madhav and Ammon who did this project in actually less than two weeks. They said they took them four days. So next time we'll give you a bigger challenge. Mahav please come. Ammon, please come on stage and please get your award. We're giving you an uh special UNOQ board edition which you can put in your college and you know uh feel proud about it. Please please come in the middle so that please give a big round of applause to Madhavan and the professor who's the mentor. Yes, very important. days because we received >> Yes. Actually, uh, Professor Dub Singh, can you guys share your experience for a quick minute? I know it was actually less than 5 days because you got the boards late. Sorry. >> Uh, yeah. So, I think you pretty much covered what the idea was. So, the idea behind this project was essentially monitor the biomedical parameters of our elderly without interfering with their ways. So essentially without having them to wear something else wear some chest monitor remember to wear a watch we could monitor their biomedical parameters right from the stick itself have inference on the on the edge and without having any cloud connectivity and proper data safety you could analyze his biomedical parameters for anomalies and be able to predict falls and uh tell them to probably rest uh using some feedback mechanisms. So yeah that's pretty much the idea. >> Thank you. Thank you. Very good job. The next project which won um was an AI for all physical AI edition which was really built on a similar technology or similar problem statement I should say uh to detect fall again could be elderly could be somebody who's not well but they were able to use UNOQ with one of our modelinos and create an algorithm completely at the edge uh to actually detect a fall and prevent a fall. So this is the team from the Adani University um Ashish, Priyanchi, Dharam and Martin. Uh if you guys could come on stage please and you know take your award. Good job guys. Very good. Nice. Really really really creative. Please give them a big round of applause. Good job team Madani. Very nice. Would you like to share a few words any of you? So yeah uh it was a very less time for us and one more thing one parallel event was going on in our university. So doing both of that at the same time was a little bit hectic for us. But then to Yeah. So as you have told key it was a fall detection. So we have encouraed what we have focused on key most of the time many elderly you know one of our relatives which fall and due to that they have to go gone through surgeries and all those stuff that's why I thought key we should make something so they could prevent or they shouldn't lose the you know golden hour of treatment. So we thought of make this >> very nice. Very good idea. Thank you. Good job. >> And the next team is coming all the way from Calikut. So this is the NIT Calikut team. Um and they did a helmet detection safety program which is very very interesting. As you guys know we can have as much police as we want but the idea is helmet is for your own safety. They did a vision detection system which allows you to start the two-heer only if you have a helmet on and as soon as you take the helmet off the ignition stops. So they did a full loop without any need of the cloud. I think it's a very interesting solution. They should talk to Qualcomm Ventures. I think that's a very good idea and there's a big serious problem. I know that uh yeah I have a turbance are slightly different. I don't need a helmet but still I've seen all my friends not ride with helmets which is interesting. So please welcome on stage the NIT Calicut team Shabri, Sriam and Sri Krishna. [applause] Very good job guys. Please give them a big round of applause. Would one of you like to share some words and your experience? Uh so we had uh almost two nights to come up with this idea after getting the board a little late. So basically it is you know AI enabled safety interlock for your vehicles. The in the crux of it it just does not allow you to ride your vehicle unless you have a helmet. So we know how we overlook the helmet. We just think it's a short ride. Let us not wear a helmet. But in that short right the possibility of a casualty is not zero. So something like this will save a lot of lives and will save you from the bills which you pay to the police department as a fine. So this is an idea which could be potentially helpful to a lot of people in our country especially. So that's it. Thank you. >> How long did it take you to do this and how was your experience? >> Uh we took uh two nights. [laughter] >> Okay. And it was a very interesting experience. We we didn't sleep. We were just up overnight and we were trying to figure out uh the new board actually it the documentation and everything is new and we were trying to figure out everything and it was a very great experience actually. >> Thank you. Thank you very much. Good job guys. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. >> Thank you Fabio. Thank you for awarding and I know Fabio loves to do this and award all the students. You know this is the prototype. Let's take this to scale. So to take this to scale, we have a partner who's very interesting. Um the partner is a the co-founders have tons of experience in higher education. They've been doing this for multiple multiple decades. You know, uh they don't look as old, but they have a lot of experience. Uh I'd like to invite on stage Mr. Naval Shakla and Mr. Mahesh Khanal. And I think the idea there is to really talk about how we will take this from a scaling into the higher education um side of things. um and you know really make this example that we saw available to hundreds and thousands of students. >> Thanks Kun. >> Uh yeah so uh as uh the Fabio mentioned that you know uh the Arduino has been trying to uh look at the ecosystem. uh I think u I remember uh few months back when Gonit mentioned that you know if you can if you can work together on the high education side of it you know I think both of us come from publishing background you work for uh possibly the top five international publishers there so we've been dealing with content and all but it's been an interesting experience uh to build this whole ecosystem so when we talk about the university education in India we largely talk about uh a theoretical framework right Um so when we got this mandate uh from Arduino we started thinking about it that you know how do we build this uh ecosystem so what we did that you know the first curriculum we brought in was a prototyping uh curriculum you know so this was a 4 credit 60-hour curriculum uh which is largely uh you know uh helping student at the base level because what's happening uh in higher education in India that you know u possibly the 50% of the student who are doing the computer science IT AI kind of uh courses uh from the year one itself they talk about the software right so they don't really deal with the hardware so we thought that you know it's important that you know uh to uh to look at that you know how do we engage them in the uh hands-on education and with uh with my colleagues MKkesh and Hardik uh we started this journey and uh within less than a month's time I think uh with the kind of uh with the kind of research And with the kind of reviewers help and all uh assistant we could build this up you know I mean so now we have uh uh the uh curriculum which is for prototyping and uh when we talk about prototyping the journey started that you know how do we build master curriculum and then we started working on application for various industries like uh plastic uh biotechnology uh uh textile uh design all those years. So you know uh as the journey started with master then we got into creating another 12 specialized curriculum with lot more application driven to uh these uh these 12 field uh my colleague Hardik uh who heads the training uh and content for us. uh yesterday uh last couple of days he's been training the professor in SRM University in Chennai on automobile engineering side of it you know I mean it's an amazing uh uh this thing you know so on that we have started already training uh the student so idea here is that you know how do we build how how do we get the prototyping curriculum in the uh in the engineering curriculum so that we build this hands-on uh base there and then we build a uh two semester course on AJI uh which we can call it as edge AI, edge computing or physical AI. So I'm different university may like to call it differently but with the different feedback from uh this thing then we talked about much detail uh curriculum later on on the lab infrastructure side of it uh we already have the support from uh Arino on the uh creating 10 COE's and the smart prototyping lab for the colleges who just want to introduce the uh prototyping uh curriculum. uh so these are the content we already build in I think we'll also take this opportunity to launch uh uh first to book on ai uh uh through this and we'll request the gonit and fabio to uh just come with us uh so these are the kind of uh uh learning content uh we've already developed on it uh most probably this will be launched uh the full uh uh curriculum will be available uh by April and the faculty professional development program also been built there uh the event the national hackathon as we speak I think we are already working on it. It's going to be a very large format. We are building possibly one of the largest format in the national hackathon. And uh last but not the least uh we are talking about uh the community engagement the campus ambassador program in our earlier uh uh this thing we have built some of the large uh campus engagement programs in in the publishing operations. So something like that we like to repeat here you know mean uh next slide. So so yeah so this is uh the outcome I think our uh our target is to connect with 2.2 2 million student uh in uh close to 60 to 80 month uh months time and uh 80 uh 80,000 prof faculty professional development is what we intend to do it you know um and finally these are the u uh the AGI curriculum because I think right now we are talking about UNOQ and uh the AGI side of it. So we now have a choice that you know we have a one semester course on Agi, we have a two semester course uh this thing uh the eighth uh credit and finally we just uh are launching also a course on u the minor degree course on uh AGI which is close to 18 credit uh you know so these are the three options available. So those institution who wants uh to go into the research side of it they can take possibly the two semester course where they start from the prototyping and going there or come from uh the Mtech level uh to the bic level and all you know so that's where we are you know >> okay we'll take a photograph to announce this uh new curriculum Fabio please come uh this is the official now um edge AI curriculum for higher education that we're launching and then of course more to come Please, please. You did all the work. [laughter] >> Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Novel. Thank you, K. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> All right. Um, now let's see. Um, I know we're running out of time, but we'll make this work. Um, how do we scale this to industry? Right. I think that's the most important question. Yes, we're doing this innovation. Great. love it. We need to take it to industry. Um we have a partner uh Judge Group which is a partner with us globally. You know they do a lot of work for us in the US. They do a lot of projects for us in India and they also have this unique advantage of having the mindset of having a constraint plus uh you know very innovative mindset and creative mindset which can work for solutions in the US and in India. I'd like to invite on stage the chief technical officer Mr. Kanesh Shagaral. if you could come on stage uh and also Nitesh Kumar who's a solution architect and Prashanti Yadav who's a solution architect to do a demo and show us live how this thing works in the industry. So uh Kanesh welcome. Thank you for coming. [applause] >> Please wrap it up. Tell us how this is going to scale. And that's the clicker. Thank you. Thank you Gon. So yes as an u industry participant I think the major challenge because we work across different industries and our focus as a company has always been on research and development prototyping early identifying and solving the business problems and the major challenge for us from an industry perspective is that how to solve this problem early how to prototype this very quickly and that's where this partnership really helped us because we were able to collaborate so the solution that used to take us months and identifying the issues later. We were able to do that in months to weeks and weeks to days. So we were able to execute use this new board and we were able to do that in just 7 days. So if you look into the technical synergy right we were able to use the efficient uh neural network processing with AI accelerators. We were able to use real-time sensors as well to bring in that and we were able to use scalable edge native connectivity as well. So that was the technical synergy that we were able to do from our expertise perspective because we have focused a lot from an industry perspective across different industries and focus was on agriculture. Uh so agriculture is an industry where we have focused a lot. We have collaborated with ministry of agriculture. We participated at a industry and academia level as well with these ecosystem. And if you look into this, we bring those domain specific AI models and for the demo that my team will be demonstrating, Nitish and Prashant, we are focusing on a model where we are trying to identify weed and so it's a good model that can be done into a robotic as well. So it's a good convergence of robotic edge AI implementation on the ground. So what we have done is that we've integrated sensor suites and control logic for autonomous detection. So that's a very very powerful prototyping that can be done in days and then it is an end to-end system integration from embedded to cloud dashboard. So from a scalability perspective because you have a prototype and then you want to test it and you want to create those test beds and we were able to execute that test beds on the cloud. So that really helps us because then we were able to change configuration on from a software perspective execute and see the performance on a real-time basis and how this is helping us. So from a strategic impact right if you're looking into technology transformation in the agriculture sector it's very important for us to build these physibility of these prototypes very early in the cycle. So we were able to execute that. Obviously when you are looking into the sustainability because sustainability is a bigger area and if you have a board that is available which has a good energy footprint where you can reduce that significantly then obviously you're improving the sustainability footprint as well right and obviously it's important that you prototype you build a product but commercialization is something very important. So if you're able to identify issues early in the game then it's easy for you to commercialize that early and make revenue from that. So when it comes to value proposition right it's very important to have a good edge hardware reliability and the application intelligence. So we were able to converge them together to ensure that we are able to empower the agricultural ecosystem. Okay. So the whole idea is to be smart responsible and scalable for the digital agricultural system. So from scale to real world which is a production grade smart agriculture system. So what we're trying to do here is that multiple field devices. So if you want to deploy as I was talking about scalability right you can do that on tractors you can do that on drones multiple use cases you can deploy that and execute that and uh each node publishes to unique topics as well. when it comes to fleet management. So I want to have different robots, I can have different drones and I want to configure them with different configurations. I'll be able to do that, right? And the best part is the data pipeline. I can store the detections, I can do that on snapshots. So when it comes to logging of the prototype, the results validation, I'll be able to do that and have the validation logs available. Now when it comes to real world features, it's about precision spraying, right? Because what we were able to build in like 7 days. We were not that competent that you were able to build a prototype in 2 days that some of the students were able to but it took us 7 days to build and identify these weeds and identifying that you know how you can spray only on them. From a safety and reliability because from a compliance perspective at an industry level when you build solutions you have to build solutions at a scale level. So safety and reliability is very important and we were able to those uh cooldowns rebound logics and fail safe and when it comes to explanability and the monitoring that's important. So that is something that we were able to execute. Now I'll invite uh Nitish and Prashant to take it forward and demonstrate what we were able to build. Thank you. [applause] So uh we just want to start with the ordin board. So when the open-source hardware and the open-source software integrates then it comes our impactful AI. So over here we have used everything which is available in the market any organization any enterprise even a school college can do a project on it. So all the software which is it is running it is open source and the obviously ordino is also open source. So over here we have trained a basic model for a specific 3,000 images around and we have done the uh training on uh using tensorflow light everybody knows that. So the images you could see over here we have integrated all the sensors in a serial chain and all the data is coming onto the board directly and after that uh in order to go ahead and pro uh give you the instant results complete model is running it will take a image process the image and tell that whether it is a crop or a weed and perform the action at the same time. So it we it has a servo which can go ahead and rotate the pesticide sprayer to the exact location. Then we have a distance in the movement sensor. Apart from that there is a relay attached to it and relay can turn it on and off at the same time. So you can go ahead and check uh like you can also come to our booth to watch the demo. So we did not have much time to explain it completely. So it uh the model is completely trained on the open source side. So in order to get a impactful AI this is the basic model which we have trained and uh it's completely working project and it can be scale to a uh industry level. >> Thank you. [applause] I think the crux of today's discussion was that the future of AI will not be built by a few but it will be built by many and that journey starts with access. Thank you for being part of this conversation. We look forward to building this future together. And to end this, I'll invite Fabio Gon and everyone who participated for a group photograph, please. [applause] Thank you everybody.
