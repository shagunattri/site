- Cred(too many gimmicks, but works for its segment - though need revamp to justify valuation and improve prod. features)
  - Problems
    - unnecessary animations
    - stupid music and effects
    - their focus is to server the top earners but they want sleek and uasble functionality over gimmicks
    - they want things to get done
      - why can i only scan via QR code
      - why not enter phone number
      - their dev and release cycle is slow
      - thus have to spend more on gimmicks and stupid marketing ploys that get attention and talk but only for the top ones
      - simple things are just hard to get done
      - Store is great, based on the way it is designed and strucutred
        - low ticket
        - high value
        - good inventory
        - 
      - Raffle and bidding was an overengineerd and overdone activity
      - cards and core functionality is solidly built
      - PO: Fi will overtake Cred as they have more target market
        - the cred team will not be able to figure out what to do with all these resources and only the founders and their founding team can get them out of this blackhole
        - They will probably look to incentivise some govt. scheme or policy change and capture the market through that - see their credit card solution
        - exclusivity works to a certain scale and audience, but beyond that you have to diversify and it is a delicate balance you have to deal with between numbers for growth and dilution of the experience and the quality  for the masses.
